## Abstract 
  We investigate the connection between steering and contextuality in general
probabilistic theories. We show that for a class of bipartite states the
steerability of the state by given set of measurements is equivalent to
non-existence of preparation noncontextual hidden variable model for certain
restricted theory constructed from the given state and measurements. The
connection between steering and contextuality is provided by the concept of
incompatibility in restricted theories, which we also investigate.
