## Abstract 
  The $\alpha$-sandwiched Rényi divergence satisfies the data processing
inequality, i.e. monotonicity under quantum operations, for $\alpha\geq 1/2$.
In this article, we derive a necessary and sufficient algebraic condition for
equality in the data processing inequality for the $\alpha$-sandwiched Rényi
divergence for all $\alpha\geq 1/2$. For the range $\alpha\in [1/2,1)$, our
result provides the only condition for equality obtained thus far. To prove our
result, we first consider the special case of partial trace, and derive a
condition for equality based on the original proof of the data processing
inequality by Frank and Lieb [J. Math. Phys. 54.12 (2013), p. 122201] using a
strict convexity/concavity argument. We then generalize to arbitrary quantum
operations via the Stinespring Representation Theorem. As applications of our
condition for equality in the data processing inequality, we deduce conditions
for equality in various entropic inequalities. We formulate a Rényi version
of the Araki-Lieb inequality and analyze the case of equality, generalizing a
result by Carlen and Lieb [Lett. Math. Phys. 101.1 (2012), pp. 1-11] about
equality in the original Araki-Lieb inequality. Furthermore, we prove a general
lower bound on a Rényi version of the entanglement of formation, and observe
that it is attained by states saturating the Rényi version of the Araki-Lieb
inequality. Finally, we prove that the known upper bound on the entanglement
fidelity in terms of the usual fidelity is saturated only by pure states.
