**Remark:** Is this the same as the [TQC21](REF_lami2021/tqc_abstract.pdf)? Seems similar, but points to a different
paper: [arXiv:2003.08895](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08895)

**Report:**
Quantum data hiding for CV systems with respect to LOCC and GOCC measurements is studied. Existence of data hiding
against LOCC is quite clear also for CV systems, the author studies the bounds of data hiding if the energy of the
states is restricted. The method of the proof is practically the same as in finite dimensions, mimicking the
teleportation argument of Ref. [41]. For this, a new bound is found on the accuracy of the Braunstein-Kimble teleportation protocol,
using a recently proved upper bound on the energy constrained diamond norm distance between displacement channels (Ref.
[29]). 
As for GOCC, some types of states (thermal, Fock states) are studied and it is shown that data hiding is not possible,
but  a very nice example with even and odd thermal states in single mode is found where data hiding occurs.  

Quantum data hiding was studied before mostly in finite dimensions against LOCC, there are yet not many works that study
this phenomenon in the CV case with the particular types of measurements.  The results in LOCC case are not so surprising but the bounds on the teleportation protocol are of separate interest and have potential applications in designing quantum circuits. GOCC measurements are commonly used in CV systems but it seems that data hiding in this context was scarcely investigated before. 
In short, the paper brings important theoretical results  with potential technological applications. I recommend the talk for QIP.
