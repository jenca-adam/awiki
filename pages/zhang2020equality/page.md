## Abstract 
The $\alpha$-$z$ Rényi relative entropies are a two-parameter family of Rényi relative entropies that are quantum generalizations of the classical $\alpha$-Rényi relative entropies. In \cite{zhang20CFL} we decided the full range of $(\alpha,z)$ for which the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) is valid. In this paper we give algebraic conditions for the equality in DPI. For the full range of parameters $(\alpha,z)$, we give necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. For most parameters we give equivalent conditions. This generalizes and strengthens the results of Leditzky, Rouz{é} and Datta in \cite{LRD17DPI}.
