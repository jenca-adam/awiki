## Abstract 
  We consider the problem of discriminating two different quantum states in the
setting of asymptotically many copies, and determine the optimal strategy that
minimizes the total probability of error. This leads to the identification of
the quantum Chernoff bound, thereby solving a long standing open problem. The
bound reduces to the classical Chernoff bound when the quantum states under
consideration commute. The quantum Chernoff bound is the natural symmetric
distance measure between quantum states because of its clear operational
meaning and because of the fact that it does not seem to share the undesirable
features of other distance measures like the fidelity, the trace norm and the
relative entropy.
