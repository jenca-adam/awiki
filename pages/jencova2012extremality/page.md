## Abstract 
  A generalized channel is a completely positive map that preserves trace on a
given subspace. We find conditions under which a generalized channel with
respect to a positively generated subspace J is an extreme point in the set of
all such generalized channels. As a special case, this yields extremality
conditions for quantum protocols. In particular, we obtain new extremality
conditions for quantum 1-testers with 2 outcomes, which correspond to yes/no
measurements on the set of quantum channels.
