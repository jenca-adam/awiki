## Abstract 
  Observables on effect algebras and their fuzzy versions obtained by means of
confidence measures (Markov kernels) are studied. It is shown that, on effect
algebras with the (E)-property, given an observable and a confidence measure,
there exists a fuzzy version of the observable. Ordering of observables
according to their fuzzy properties is introduced, and some minimality
conditions with respect to this ordering are found. Applications of some
results of classical theory of experiments are considered.
