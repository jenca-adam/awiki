## Abstract 
  We introduce the notion of trace-norm isometric encoding and explore its
implications for passive and active methods to protect quantum information
against errors. Beside providing an operational foundations to the "subsystems
principle" [E. Knill, Phys. Rev. A 74, 042301 (2006)] for faithfully realizing
quantum information in physical systems, our approach allows additional
explicit connections between noiseless, protectable, and correctable quantum
codes to be identified. Robustness properties of isometric encodings against
imperfect initialization and/or deviations from the intended error models are
also analyzed.
