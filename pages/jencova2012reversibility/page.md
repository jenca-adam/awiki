## Abstract 
  We give a list of equivalent conditions for reversibility of the adjoint of a
unital Schwarz map with respect to a set of quantum states. A large class of
such conditions is given by preservation of distinguishability measures:
f-divergences, $L_1$ -distance, quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding distances; here we
summarize and extend the known results. Moreover, we prove a number of
conditions in terms of the properties of a quantum Radon-Nikodym derivative and
factorization of states in the given set. Finally, we show that reversibility
is equivalent with preservation of a large class of quantum Fisher informations
and $\chi^2$-divergences.
