## Abstract 
Audenaert and Datta recently introduced a two-parameter family of relative Rényi entropies, known as the $\alpha$-$z$-relative Rényi entropies. The definition of the $\alpha$-$z$-relative Rényi entropy unifies all previously proposed definitions of the quantum Rényi divergence of order $\alpha$ under a common framework. Here we will prove that the $\alpha$-$z$-relative Rényi entropies are a proper generalization of the quantum relative entropy by computing the limit of the $\alpha$-$z$ divergence as $\alpha$ approaches one and $z$ is an arbitrary function of $\alpha$. We also show that certain operationally relevant families of Rényi divergences are differentiable at $\alpha = 1$. Finally, our analysis reveals that the derivative at $\alpha = 1$ evaluates to half the relative entropy variance, a quantity that has attained operational significance in second-order quantum hypothesis testing.
