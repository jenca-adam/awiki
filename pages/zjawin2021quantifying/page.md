## Abstract 
  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is often (implicitly or explicitly)
taken to be evidence for spooky action-at-a-distance. An alternative
perspective on steering - endorsed by EPR themselves - is that Alice has no
causal influence on the physical state of Bob's system; rather, Alice merely
updates her knowledge of the state of Bob's system by performing a measurement
on a system correlated with his. In this work, we elaborate on this perspective
(from which the very term `steering' is seen to be inappropriate), and we are
led to a resource-theoretic treatment of correlations in EPR scenarios. For
both bipartite and multipartite scenarios, we develop the resulting resource
theory, wherein the free operations are local operations and shared randomness
(LOSR). We show that resource conversion under free operations in this paradigm
can be evaluated with a single instance of a semidefinite program, making the
problem numerically tractable. Moreover, we find that the structure of the
pre-order of resources features interesting properties, such as infinite
families of incomparable resources. In showing this, we derive new EPR resource
monotones. We also discuss advantages of our approach over a pre-existing
proposal for a resource theory of `steering', and discuss how our approach
sheds light on basic questions, such as which multipartite assemblages are
classically explainable.
