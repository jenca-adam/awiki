## Abstract 
  It is known that a necessary and sufficient condition for equality in the
data processing inequality (DPI) for the quantum relative entropy is the
existence of a recovery map. We show that equality in DPI for a sandwiched
RÃ©nyi relative $\alpha$-entropy with $\alpha>1$ is also equivalent to this
property. For the proof, we use an interpolating family of $L_p$-norms with
respect to a state.
