## Incompatibility


### Witnesses, spectrahedra, cross norms

**people:** Ion, Andreas

**directory:/work**/compatibility/witnesses

* my notes on [spectrahedra](PROJECT_gpt/aj_spectrahedra.pdf)
* notes by Andreas and Ion on spectrahedra and [gpt, v1](PROJECT_gpt/bluhm.pdf), [updated, v2](PROJECT_gpt/bluhm2.pdf)
* my notes on witnesses and [symmetric state spaces](PROJECT_gpt/notes_symmetric.pdf)

**Questions:**

* the cross norm $\gamma$ [defined here](PROJECT_gpt/notes_symmetric.pdf), the dual cross norm is on $A\otimes \ell_1^k$, that is
on $k$-tuples $f_1,\dots,f_k\in A(K)$. This should relate to existence of positive extensions, as in [the b-n notes](PROJECT_gpt/bluhm.pdf): $\gamma^\*(f_1,\dots,f_k)\le 1$ iff a positive extension exists 
* related to previous: map extensions and conic programming
* incompatibility on $W$ - the min tensor product of two quantum state spaces (two qubits)
* relations of incompatibility, free spectrahedra, operator systems and norms - one should write some notes on this
* measurements with more outcomes



### Witnesses by testing problems

**people:**  Teiko, Alessandro, Claudio

* their notes on [witnesses](PROJECT_gpt/toigo.pdf) 
* their published papers:     
* my notes on [witnesses](PROJECT_gpt/aj_witnesses.pdf)
