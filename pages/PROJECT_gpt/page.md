title: General Probabilistic Theories (GPT)
---

*  **Description:** Incompatibility and related features in GPTs, obtained from the theory of ordered vector spaces and
   their tensor products. Incompatibility witnesses. Related features such as steering, Bell inequalities, CHSH. The GPT of channels.
*  **People:** Ion Nechita, Andreas Bluhm, Martin Pl√°vala  
*  **Related to:**  [comparison](PROJECT_comparison), [NC category](PROJECT_nc)   
*  **Repository:** compatibility, chsh

## Tasks

1. Write the manuscript for special issue of Journal of Physics A:    
    * check the notes(!)    
    * relation of steering and incompatibility     
    * steering - distance to barycenter, conditional states, write some remarks, unsteerable states?    
    * references, introduction    
    * relation to matrix convex sets, operator spaces, systems...    
    * examples (hmmm, $W$?)

## Ideas for further research

* incompatibility on $W$ - the min tensor product of two quantum state spaces (two qubits)
* relations of incompatibility, free spectrahedra, operator systems and norms - one should write some notes on this
* a characterization similar to tensor norms for measurements with more outcomes
