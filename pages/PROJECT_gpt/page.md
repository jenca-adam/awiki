## A. Incompatibility


### 1. Witnesses, spectrahedra, cross norms

**people:** Ion, Andreas

**directory:/work**/compatibility/witnesses

* my notes on [spectrahedra](PROJECT_gpt/aj_spectrahedra.pdf)
* notes by Andreas and Ion on spectrahedra and [gpt, v1](PROJECT_gpt/bluhm.pdf), [updated, v2](PROJECT_gpt/bluhm2.pdf)
* my notes on witnesses and [symmetric state spaces](PROJECT_gpt/notes_symmetric.pdf)

**paper**

[bluhm2020incompatibility](bluhm2020incompatibility)


**conference abstracts**

* [QIP](PROJECT_gpt/qip_abstract.pdf)    
* [AQIS](PROJECT_gpt/aqis_abstract.pdf)


**further questions:**

* incompatibility on $W$ - the min tensor product of two quantum state spaces (two qubits)
* relations of incompatibility, free spectrahedra, operator systems and norms - one should write some notes on this
* a characterization similar to tensor norms for measurements with more outcomes
* incompatibility of qubit effects and 1-summing norm: see the paper [gordon1969onpabsolutely](gordon1969onpabsolutely)








### 2. Witnesses by testing problems

**people:**  Teiko, Alessandro, Claudio

* their notes on [witnesses](PROJECT_gpt/toigo.pdf) 
* their published papers:     
* my notes on [witnesses](PROJECT_gpt/aj_witnesses.pdf)



### 3. Characterization as ETB maps, witnesses:
