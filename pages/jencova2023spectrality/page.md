## Abstract 
For convex and sequential effect algebras, we study spectrality in the sense of Foulis. We show that under additional conditions (strong archimedeanity, closedness in norm and a certain monotonicity property of the sequential product), such effect algebra is spectral if and only if every maximal commutative subalgebra is monotone $\sigma$-complete. Two previous results on existence of spectral resolutions in this setting are shown to require stronger assumptions.
