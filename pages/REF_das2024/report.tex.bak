This paper introduces and studies some notions of incompatibility of  sets of quantum
measurements, capturing the property that the measumeremnts in the set remain incompatible
even after undergoing some classical transformations. Namely, these transformations are
coarse grainings and some specific convex mixtures combined with permutations of the outcomes. Noise
robustness of such properties is considered and some operational witnesses are proposed,
both device independent and semi-device independent.

\textbf{Overall evaluation}

\medskip
 
The introduced variants of incompatibility properties are quite natural and as far as I
know where not studied before in this form. A similar notion appearing in the literature
is incompatibility of some subsets of the given set of measurements. The
incompatibility w.r. to convex mixtures introduced here is a generalization thereof. So
the topic of the paper is timely and of interest. 

Unfortunately, in my opinion, there is not much information gained about the introduced
notions. Already the choice of the two types of classical operations is not sufficiently
explained. As for the coarse grainings, it is clear that the set of measurements with the
specified property remains incompatible even if some measurement outcomes are
not distinguished, which is a good robustness property to have. But one
can think of other choices of post-processings of the measurements. Similarly, one could
consider more general convex mixtures of the measurements, not just given by  partitions
of the measurement set. I think the authors should include more comments about these
choices. 


For the defined notions, there are some rather trivial observations and partial results in special cases
or for specific examples, such as qubit measurements or MUBs, but these are obtained by
standard methods and it is not clear what conclusion the reader is to make.  For example, concerning the
noise robustness, two tables of results obtained by SDP for 3- and 4-dimensional MUBs are
presented, but no discussion or interpretation of these values is given. The operational
witnesses suggested here are based on well known results for Bell experiments or RACs.
Their applicability to the present notions is an interesting (albeit easy) observation
made here, but the investigation of their performance is very limited. In any case, I do
not think it is justified to write that ''...we have developed a method of operationally
witness different levels of measurement incompatibility....'' as the authors claim in the
concluding section.


In conclusion, the authors introduced  interesting notions of incompatibility for a set of
measurements, but their analysis of these notions is not yet sufficient for publication.
