## Abstract 
  We introduce a guessing game involving a quantum channel, three parties - the
sender, the receiver and an eavesdropper, Eve - and a quantum public side
channel. We prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for the quantum
channel to be antidegradable, is that Eve wins the game. We thus obtain a
complete operational characterization of antidegradable channels in a
game-theoretic framework.
