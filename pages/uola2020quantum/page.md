## Abstract 
  Quantum correlations between two parties are essential for the argument of
Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in favour of the incompleteness of quantum
mechanics. Schrödinger noted that an essential point is the fact that one
party can influence the wave function of the other party by performing suitable
measurements. He called this phenomenon quantum steering and studied its
properties, but only in the last years this kind of quantum correlation
attracted significant interest in quantum information theory. In this paper the
theory of quantum steering is reviewed. First, the basic concepts of steering
and local hidden state models are presented and their relation to entanglement
and Bell nonlocality is explained. Then various criteria for characterizing
steerability and structural results on the phenomenon are described. A detailed
discussion is given on the connections between steering and incompatibility of
quantum measurements. Finally, applications of steering in quantum information
processing and further related topics are reviewed.

* finite steering assemblages: fixed (deterministic) response functions (*holds in GPT also*)

* steering  criteria using order monotonic functions [Zhu et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04711),

* superactivation of steering: $n$-copies $\rho_{AB}^{\otimes n}$ become steerable for some $n$ if the *reduction criterion* is satisfied: $I_A\otimes \rho_B-\rho_{AB}\not\geq 0$ [quintino et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01037v1), [hsieh et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07581v3)

* Steering and incompatibility      
    * A set of measurements is incompatible if and only if it can be used to demonstrate steering [quintino et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6976v3), [uola et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.08724v1.pdf) - joint measurability for qubit observables!! -read this!!
