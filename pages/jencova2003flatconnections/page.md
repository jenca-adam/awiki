## Abstract 

Abstract:  On the manifold of positive definite matrices, we investigate the existence
of pairs of flat affine connections, dual with respect to a given monotone
metric. The connections are defined either using the $\alpha$-embeddings and
finding the duals with respect to the metric, or by means of contrast
functionals. We show that in both cases, the existence of such a pair of
connections is possible if and only if the metric is given by the
Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information.
