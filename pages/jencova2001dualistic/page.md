## Abstract 

 In the finite dimensional case, we introduce a family of torsion-free affine connections in the manifold of all invertible density matrices. These are the quantum version of Amari’s α-connections, based on the α-representation of the tangent space. The dual connections with respect to a monotone metric are, in general, not torsion-free. We compute the torsion and the Riemannian curvature. Finally, geodesics are used to define a divergence.
