{\large S. Sreekumar and M. Berta: Limit distribution theory for quantum divergences}

\end{center}
\medskip

\centerline{Referee report}

\bigskip


The paper investigates asymptotic properties of estimators of quantum divergences,
namely the quantum relative entropy and two quantum versions of R\'enyi divergences. The
estimators are obtained as the divergence $D(\hat\rho_n,\hat \sigma_n)$ for estimators
$\hat \rho_n$ and $\hat \sigma_n$ of states $\rho$ resp. $\sigma$. Under some assumption
on the asymptotic behaviour of the error of the two sequences of estimators, the limit
distributions for the divergences are obtained using their Taylor expansions. The results
are applied to problems of multiple hypothesis testing.

\textbf{Overall evaluation}
\medskip

The topic of the paper is very interesting and may have important applications in  quantum
information theory, estimation and hypothesis testing, etc. However,
the present version is not well written, the arguments are unclear and there are some
mistakes that do not seem crucial, but create some doubts about the other content of the paper. 

A large part of the paper is devoted to the derivatives and Taylor expansions of the
divergences and the involved functions. The  derivatives are obtained via  integral
representations and checking of the regularity conditions for exchanging of differentiation and
integral, or traces and integral, take up a large part of the paper. I think such
derivatives were already considered before and I am sure the authors can find the
necessary computations in the literature. On the other hand, very small space is devoted to the random density operators
which are the object of the study, the mode of their convergence and its
properties and the techniques which are used in the proofs. Such techniques may be not so
widespread in the quantum information community for which this paper surely would be
interesting. 

Although the authors briefly describe the main ideas of the proofs in the main body of the paper,
which is a good thing, the proof themselves are quite unclear. The main techniques are only
sparsely mentioned and it seems that many of the steps are just skipped. For example, I do
not understand how the Skorohod representation theorem is applied in the subsequence
argument in the proof of the theorems, the authors just write that ''This is possible by
Skorohods representation theorem (see e.g. [95])'', as if a rabbit was just taken out of the hat. 
This seems to be the crucial argument in most of
the proofs and should be better explained. There are also other points, for example the
use of the portmanteau theorem at the befinning of p.~19 (and similarly also in other
proofs). 

There are also mistakes, most notably, Lemma 1, part (i). This is quite obviously wrong,
and its proof does not make any sense.
This part is used also in the proof of part (ii), which, fortunately, is easy to see to be
true in the case when $A\ge 0$, which is the only case when it was used in the paper. 
There are also further mistakes (some of them listed below), which make it difficult to
trust the authors that reading through the unclear parts is  worth the effort. 

In conclusion, the paper should be rewritten, the techniques explained and the arguments clarified before the paper
can be reviewed.

\textbf{Some further comments}


\begin{enumerate}
\item page 10, last line: what is the meaning of $\Lambda_j^+$, $\Lambda_j^-$? I would say
that measuring $\gamma_j$  has  outcomes just $\pm1$
\item Eq.~(19a): this is not a density operator in the case that $\|\hat
s^{(n)}(\rho)\|_2>1$. The definition of $\hat\rho_n$ should be modified in an obvious way,
which seems to be also used in the proof of Proposition 1. 
\item in Eq.~(19a): also the notation $\mathbb{1}_{\|s^{(n)}\|_2\le 1}$ etc, should better
be explained.
\item Eqs.~(30) (and elsewehere) it would really be better to use a notation that shows
that these are also functions of $t$
\item page 20, last set of displayed equations: in the last line, all the ''tilded'' terms
are equal to their ''untilded'' versions, except for the last one, where it is not so
automatic. This is because we have $\rho_n\ll \sigma_n\ll \rho\ll P$, but $P\ll \sigma$,
so I do not see that $U\log\sigma U^\dagger=\log \tilde \sigma$. 
\item p.~33, first equation: which norm is this? (maybe it should be $\|\cdot\|_1$?)
\item p.~33, line 13 (displayed equation): the first term is not correct 
\item Since the statements and their proofs are at different places in the paper, I would
suggest to use one counter for all Lemmas, Propositions, Theorems, etc. Separate numbering
makes them harder to find in the text.
