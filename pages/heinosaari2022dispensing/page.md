## Abstract 
  No-broadcasting theorem is one of the most fundamental results in quantum
information theory; it guarantees that the simplest attacks on any quantum
protocol, based on eavesdropping and copying of quantum information, are
impossible. Due to the fundamental importance of the no-broadcasting theorem,
it is essential to understand the exact boundaries of this limitation. We
generalize the standard definition of broadcasting by restricting the set of
states which we want to broadcast and restricting the sets of measurements
which we use to test the broadcasting. We show that in all of the investigated
cases broadcasting is equivalent to commutativity.
