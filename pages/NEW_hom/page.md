## Some plans

* understand basic definitions: SMC closed, compact, \*-autonomous, precise relations between them. Something is in [notes](NEW_hom/definitions.pdf)     


* read [kissinger2019acategorical](kissinger2019acategorical)     
      - precausal and Kleisli categories     
      - study and understand the examples    
      - ...
      - indefinite causal order, quantum switch, witnesses

* read [simmons2022higher](simmons2022higher)  Simmons and Kissinger, signalling product (sequence operator)     


* read [santocanale2022frobenius](santocanale2022frobenius), check the "nuclear" objects in interesting \*-autonomous categories
    - this does not seem to give anything interesting

* read [hoffreumon2022projective](hoffreumon2022projective)
     - similar to my project of Afhom     
     - Afhom: category of fd vector spaces with an affine subspace     
     - we then add OVS to it: category of fd vect, but this time with a positive cone, star-autonomous subcategories here?? but with different tensor product?     
     - check references    
      

* read [milz2024characterising](milz2024characterising) quantum HOMs, projections, affine duals...

* read [milz2022resource](milz2022resource)  resource theory of causality    



     
* BaSe - category and HOM-s for GPT (OT):     
     - SMC, \*-autonomous     
     - relation to
     - HOMs of GPTs embed into BaSe?     
     - so what?





## Basic references

* [kissinger2019acategorical](kissinger2019acategorical)      Kissinger & Uijlen, precausal category $\mathcal C$, \*-autonomous category  $Caus[\mathcal C]$   
* [apadula2022nosignalling](apadula2022nosignalling)  Bisio, Perinotti framework     
* [bisio2019theoretical](bisio2019theoretical) Bisio, Perinotti framework   
* [santocanale2022frobenius](santocanale2022frobenius) frobenius structures in \*-autonomous categories
