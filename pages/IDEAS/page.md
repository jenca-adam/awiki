### Matrix majorization (and quantum majorization, whatever)

* Look at the papers [farooq2023matrix](farooq2023matrix), [verhagen2024matrix](verhagen2024matrix). 

* The papers are based on the results of Tobias Fritz [fritz2023abstract](fritz2023abstract), [fritz2021abstract](fritz2021abstract) on preordered semirings

* Is there a way to relate this to the Blackwell theorem [blackwell1951comparison](blackwell1951comparison), see also [strasser1985mathematical](BOOK_strasser1985mathematical) - characterization of the statistical preorder by $f$-divergences, statistical isomorphism by Renyi divergences...



### Equality in DPI for the Belavkin-Staszewski relaive entropy

* A question asked by Angela Capel and Andreas Bluhm     

* Find characterization for ''Markov states'': equality in DPI for $\Phi=\mathrm{Tr}\_A$, $\rho_{ABC}$, $\rho_{AB}\otimes \tau\_C$ 
* [hiai2017different](hiai2017different) some general equality conditions. In particular, by Thm. 3.37(h), equality holds iff 
$d=\sigma^{-1/2}\rho\sigma^{-1/2}$ is in the *multuplicative domain* of the Petz dual. We can find a characterization of the multiplicative domain by the Kraus operators of the map.   

* [arveson1969subalgebras](arveson1969subalgebras) Arveson's lifting theorem

### Integral representations of BS entropy

[notes](IDEAS/GL_notes.pdf)  by Filippo and Ludovico


### Compatibility of qubit effects

[grinko2024oncompatibility](grinko2024oncompatibility)  a paper by Roope Uola and Grinko, Fourier transform, look at the relation to [bluhm2022incompatibility](bluhm2022incompatibility).
