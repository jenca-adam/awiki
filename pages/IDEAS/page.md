### Equality in DPI for the Belavkin-Staszewski relaive entropy

* A question asked by Angela Capel and Andreas Bluhm     

* Find characterization for ''Markov states'': equality in DPI for $\Phi=\mathrm{Tr}\_A$, $\rho_{ABC}$, $\rho_{AB}\otimes \tau\_C$ 
* [hiai2017different](hiai2017different) some general equality conditions. In particular, by Thm. 3.37(h), equality holds iff 
$d=\sigma^{-1/2}\rho\sigma^{-1/2}$ is in the *multuplicative domain* of the Petz dual. We can find a characterization of the multiplicative domain by the Kraus operators of the map.
