## Abstract 
  A quantum binary experiment consists of a pair of density operators on a
finite dimensional Hilbert space. An experiment E is called \epsilon-deficient
with respect to another experiment F if, up to \epsilon, its risk functions are
not worse than the risk functions of F, with respect to all statistical
decision problems. It is known in the theory of classical statistical
experiments that 1. for pairs of probability distributions, one can restrict to
testing problems in the definition of deficiency and 2. that 0-deficiency is a
necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a stochastic mapping that
maps one pair onto the other. We show that in the quantum case, the property 1.
holds precisely if E consist of commuting densities. As for property 2., we
show that if E is 0-deficient with respect to F, then there exists a completely
positive mapping that maps E onto F, but it is not necessarily trace
preserving.
