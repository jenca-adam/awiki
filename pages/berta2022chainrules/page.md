## Abstract 
  Divergence chain rules for channels relate the divergence of a pair of
channel inputs to the divergence of the corresponding channel outputs. An
important special case of such a rule is the data-processing inequality, which
tells us that if the same channel is applied to both inputs then the divergence
cannot increase. Based on direct matrix analysis methods, we derive several
RÃ©nyi divergence chain rules for channels in the quantum setting. Our results
simplify and in some cases generalise previous derivations in the literature.
