## Abstract 
We use the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory and the Kubo-Ando operator mean to write down a large class of multi-state quantum $f$-divergences and prove that they satisfy the data processing inequality. For two states, this class includes the $(\alpha,z)$-Rényi divergences, the $f$-divergences of Petz, and the measures in \cite{matsumoto2015new} as special cases. The method used is the interpolation theory of non-commutative $L^p_\omega$ spaces and the result applies to general von Neumann algebras including the local algebra of quantum field theory. We conjecture that these multi-state Rényi divergences have operational interpretations in terms of the optimal error probabilities in asymmetric multi-state quantum state discrimination.
