## Abstract

The paper is devoted to the investigation of the notion of sufficiency in quantum statistics. Three kinds of this notion are considered: plain sufficiency (called simply: sufficiency), Petz’s sufficiency, and Umegaki’s sufficiency. The problem of the existence and structure of the minimal sufficient subalgebra is analyzed in some detail, conditions yielding equivalence of the three modes of sufficiency are considered, and quantum Basu’s theorem is obtained. Moreover, it is shown that an interesting “factorization theorem” of Jenčová and Petz needs some corrections to hold true.
