## Abstract 
  In the simple quantum hypothesis testing problem, upper bound with asymmetric
setting is shown by using a quite useful inequality by Audenaert et al,
quant-ph/0610027, which was originally invented for symmetric setting. Using
this upper bound, we obtain the Hoeffding bound, which are identical with the
classical counter part if the hypotheses, composed of two density operators,
are mutually commutative. Our upper bound improves the bound by Ogawa-Hayashi,
and also provides a simpler proof of the direct part of the quantum Stein's
lemma. Further, using this bound, we obtain a better exponential upper bound of
the average error probability of classical-quantum channel coding.
