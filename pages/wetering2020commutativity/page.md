## Abstract

  While Jordan algebras are commutative, their non-associativity makes it so
that the Jordan product operators do not necessarily commute. When the product
operators of two elements commute, the elements are said to operator commute.
In some Jordan algebras operator commutation can be badly behaved, for instance
having elements $a$ and $b$ operator commute, while $a^2$ and $b$ do not
operator commute. In this paper we study JB-algebras, real Jordan algebras
which are also Banach spaces in a compatible manner, of which C\*-algebras are
examples. We show that elements $a$ and $b$ in a JB-algebra operator commute if
and only if they span an associative sub-algebra of mutually operator commuting
elements, and hence operator commutativity in JB-algebras is as well-behaved as
it can be. Letting $Q_a$ denote the quadratic operator of $a$, we also show
that positive $a$ and $b$ operator commute if and only if $Q_a b^2 = Q_b a^2$.
We use this result to conclude that the unit interval of a JB-algebra is a
sequential effect algebra as defined by Gudder and Greechie.
