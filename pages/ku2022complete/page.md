## Abstract 
  Quantum steering is the central resource for one-sided device-independent
quantum information. It is manipulated via one-way local operations and
classical communication, such as local filtering on the trusted party. Here, we
provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a steering assemblage to be
transformable into another one via local filtering. We characterize the
equivalence classes with respect to filters in terms of the steering equivalent
observables measurement assemblage (SEO), first proposed to connect the problem
of steerability with measurement incompatibility. We provide an efficient
method to compute the maximal extractable steerability via local filters and
show that it coincides with the incompatibility of the SEO. Moreover, we show
that there always exists a bipartite state that provides an assemblage with
steerability equal to the incompatibility of the measurements on the untrusted
party. Finally, we investigate the optimal success probability and rates for
transformation protocols (distillation and dilution) in the single-shot
scenario together with examples.
