## Abstract 
This paper continues our foundational work on real algebra with preordered semifields and semirings. We prove two abstract Vergleichsstellensätze for commutative preordered semirings of polynomial growth. These generalize the results of Part I in that we now no longer assume $1 \ge 0$. This adds substantial technical complications: our Vergleichsstellensätze now also need to take into account infinitesimal information encoded in the form of monotone derivations in addition to the monotone homomorphisms to the nonnegative reals and tropical reals. The proof relies on a number of technical results that we develop along the way, including surprising implications between inequalities in preordered semifields and a type classification for multiplicatively Archimedean fully preordered semifields.
A companion paper uses these results in order to derive a limit theorem for random walks on topological abelian groups which provides sufficient and close to necessary conditions for when one random walk will dominate another at late times.
