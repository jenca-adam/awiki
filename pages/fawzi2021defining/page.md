## Abstract 

  We introduce a new quantum Rényi divergence $D_\alpha^{\sharp}$ for $\alpha
\in (1,\infty)$ defined in terms of a convex optimization program. This
divergence has several desirable computational and operational properties such
as an efficient semidefinite programming representation for states and
channels, and a chain rule property. An important property of this new
divergence is that its regularization is equal to the sandwiched (also known as
the minimal) quantum Rényi divergence. This allows us to prove several
results. First, we use it to get a converging hierarchy of upper bounds on the
regularized sandwiched $\alpha$-Rényi divergence between quantum channels for
$\alpha > 1$. Second it allows us to prove a chain rule property for the
sandwiched $\alpha$-Rényi divergence for $\alpha > 1$ which we use to
characterize the strong converse exponent for channel discrimination. Finally
it allows us to get improved bounds on quantum channel capacities.
