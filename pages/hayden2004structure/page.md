## Abstract 
  We give an explicit characterisation of the quantum states which saturate the
strong subadditivity inequality for the von Neumann entropy. By combining a
result of Petz characterising the equality case for the monotonicity of
relative entropy with a recent theorem by Koashi and Imoto, we show that such
states will have the form of a so-called short quantum Markov chain, which in
turn implies that two of the systems are independent conditioned on the third,
in a physically meaningful sense. This characterisation simultaneously
generalises known necessary and sufficient entropic conditions for quantum
error correction as well as the conditions for the achievability of the Holevo
bound on accessible information.
