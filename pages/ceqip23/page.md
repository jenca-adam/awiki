1. Mateus Araújo. Quantum key distribution rates from semidefinite programming (3) [arxiv:2211.05725](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05725.pdf) 

     Authors:  Mateus Araújo, Marcus Huber, Miguel Navascués, Matej Pivoluska and Armin Tavakoli
     
     Notes:

    - QKD with characterized devices   
    - Brown, Fawzi and Fawzi developed a SDP hierarchy fo device independent QKD (using a variational formula for  the relative
     entropy, also in von Neumann algebras  [arXiv:2106.13692](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13692)   
    - this metod is adapted to QKD with characterized devices, which simplifies things    
    - the optimalization problem is turned to an SDP using a one-sided method (on Eve's side)
     
     
     Description:
     
          An SDP hierarchy for QKD rates is obtained by adapting a method from [1], where a SDP hierarchy  for
          device independent conditional von Neumann entropy was obtained using a variational formula for quantum relative 
          entropy. In the case of characterized devices, the complexity of the SDP hierarchy is reduced, since the NPA 
          hierarchy needed in the DI case  can be replaced by a simpler one-side method.   The performance of the technique 
          is illustrated on examples. 
     
          The proposed method seems quite powerful and the techniques involved would be interesting for the audience.

2. Albert Rico. Entanglement detection with trace polynomials (6) 

    Authors: Albert Rico and Felix Huber

    Notes:

    - entanglement detection
    - nonlinear usage of linear entanglement witnesses
    - ''based on this fact'' but no ''fact'' is provided?  
    - nonlinear witnesses are obtained by tensor products of linear witnesses with other witnesses or positive operators 
    *across* copies of the state. Examples are shown that this can produce a nonlinear witness even if the individual  witnesses
    on a single copy do not detect entanglement.
    - a method of producing such witnesses from matrix inequalities is provided
    - the abstract is not very clearly written!
    - randomized measurements?



    Description: 

    It is observed that nonlinear entanglement witnesses can be  obtained by tensor products of linear witnesses with other witnesses or positive operators applied *across* copies of the state. Examples are shown that this can produce a nonlinear witness even if the individual  witnesses on a single copy do not detect entanglement. A method of producing such witnesses from matrix inequalities is provided, with an experimantal realization through randomized measurements.

    The abstract is not very well written. It is not clear to what extent the presented observations are new.

3. Sébastien Designolle. Improved local models and new Bell inequalities via Frank-Wolfe algorithms (10)


    Authors: Sébastien Designolle, Gabriele Iommazzo, Mathieu Besançon, Sebastian Knebel, Patrick Gelß, and Sebastian Pokutta

    Notes:

    - New Bell inequalities with a new algorithm
    - membership problem for a local polytope: find deterministic decomposition if local, a separating hyperplane (Bell inequality) otherwise
    - bipartite: Werner states - threshold between local and nonlocal behaviour detectable by projective measrements - lower and upper bounds, some improvements


    Description: A new algorithm is applied to obtain improved upper and lower bounds on the critical visibility for Werner states
 that is the threshold between local and non-local behaviour under projective measurements.

    From the presented abstract, this contribution seems a bit too technical for a talk.

4. Martin Johannes Renner. Simulating qubit correlations with classical communication (11)

    Authors: Martin J. Renner, Armin Tavakoli, and Marco Túlio Quintino

    Notes:


    Description: It is shown that in the general prepare and measure scenario for a qubit, all correlations can be simulated by 
    shared randomness and two classical bits of communication. The protocol seems to be some modification of the protocol in [5].
    Further, an explicit quantum protocol is presented to show that communication of a classical trit is not enough. Similar results are obtained for the Bell scenario.

    This could be a nice poster, or a talk if there is a free slot.

1. Ritabrata Sengupta. Conditions for local transformations between sets of quantum states (31) [arxiv:2204.08821](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08821.pdf)

    Authors: SOMSHUBHRO BANDYOPADHYAY, SARONATH HALDER, AND RITABRATA SENGUPTA

    Notes: 

    - conversion of a set of pure bipartite states to another set by LOCC    
    - a set of necessary conditions is presented    
    - it is shown by examples that these conditions are independent and not sufficient    
    - examples are provided that the sets of transformations LOCC SEPP PPT ALL are separated by transformation problems.


    Description: The problem here is the possibility of conversion between two sets of pure bipartite states by a LOCC transformation is investigated. A set of necessary conditions is presented and it is shown by examples that these conditions are independednt and not sufficient. Furthermore, it is demonstrated by examples that the sets of transformations LOCC SEPP PPT ALL are separated by transformation problems.

    This is an interesting and important question, but the presented necessary conditions seem quite straightforward. The particular examples separating the conditions and the set of stransformations may be interesting and provide some insight, but it does not seem to be sufficient for a talk.
