1. Mateus Araújo. Quantum key distribution rates from semidefinite programming (3) [arxiv:2211.05725](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05725.pdf) 

     Authors:  Mateus Araújo, Marcus Huber, Miguel Navascués, Matej Pivoluska and Armin Tavakoli
     
     Notes:

    - QKD with characterized devices   
    - Brown, Fawzi and Fawzi developed a SDP hierarchy fo device independent QKD (using a variational formula for  the relative
     entropy, also in von Neumann algebras  [arXiv:2106.13692](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13692)   
    - this metod is adapted to QKD with characterized devices, which simplifies things    
    - the optimalization problem is turned to an SDP using a one-sided method (on Eve's side)
     
     
     Description:
     
          An SDP hierarchy for QKD rates is obtained by adapting a method from [1], where a SDP hierarchy  for
          device independent conditional von Neumann entropy was obtained using a variational formula for quantum relative 
          entropy. In the case of characterized devices, the complexity of the SDP hierarchy is reduced, since the NPA 
          hierarchy needed in the DI case  can be replaced by a simpler one-side method.   The performance of the technique 
          is illustrated on examples. 
     
          The proposed method seems quite powerful and the techniques involved are interesting for the CEQIP audience. I am 
          inclined to recommend as a talk.

2. Albert Rico. Entanglement detection with trace polynomials (6) 

    Authors: Albert Rico and Felix Huber

    Notes:

    - entanglement detection
    - nonlinear usage of linear entanglement witnesses
    - ''based on this fact'' but no ''fact'' is provided?  
    - nonlinear witnesses are obtained by tensor products of linear witnesses with other witnesses or positive operators 
    *across* copies of the state. Examples are shown that this can produce a nonlinear witness even if the individual  witnesses
    on a single copy do not detect entanglement.
    - a method of producing such witnesses from matrix inequalities is provided
    - the abstract is not very clearly written!
    - randomized measurements?



    Description: 

    It is observed that nonlinear entanglement witnesses can be  obtained by tensor products of linear witnesses with other witnesses or positive operators applied *across* copies of the state. Examples are shown that this can produce a nonlinear witness even if the individual  witnesses on a single copy do not detect entanglement. A method of producing such witnesses from matrix inequalities is provided, with an experimantal realization through randomized measurements.

    The abstract is not very well written, it is not clear to what extent the presented observations are new.

3. Sébastien Designolle. Improved local models and new Bell inequalities via Frank-Wolfe algorithms (10)


    Authors: Sébastien Designolle, Gabriele Iommazzo, Mathieu Besançon, Sebastian Knebel, Patrick Gelß, and Sebastian Pokutta

    Notes:

    - New Bell inequalities with a new algorithm
    - membership problem for a local polytope: find deterministic decomposition if local, a separating hyperplane (Bell inequality) otherwise
    - bipartite: Werner states - threshold between local and nonlocal behaviour detectable by projective measrements - lower and upper bounds, some improvements


    Description: A new algorithm is applied to obtain improved upper and lower bounds on the critical visibility for Werner states
 that is the threshold between local and non-local behaviour under projective measurements.

    From the presented abstract, this contribution is quite specific and seems a bit too technical for a talk.

4. Martin Johannes Renner. Simulating qubit correlations with classical communication (11)

    Authors: Martin J. Renner, Armin Tavakoli, and Marco Túlio Quintino

    Notes:


    Description: It is shown that in the general prepare and measure scenario for a qubit, all correlations can be simulated by 
    shared randomness and two classical bits of communication. The protocol seems to be some modification of the protocol in [5].
    Further, an explicit quantum protocol is presented to show that communication of a classical trit is not enough. Similar results are obtained for the Bell scenario.

    This could be a nice poster, or a talk if there is a free slot.

1. Ritabrata Sengupta. Conditions for local transformations between sets of quantum states (31) [arxiv:2204.08821](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08821.pdf)

    Authors: SOMSHUBHRO BANDYOPADHYAY, SARONATH HALDER, AND RITABRATA SENGUPTA

    Notes: 

    - conversion of a set of pure bipartite states to another set by LOCC    
    - a set of necessary conditions is presented    
    - it is shown by examples that these conditions are independent and not sufficient    
    - examples are provided that the sets of transformations LOCC SEPP PPT ALL are separated by transformation problems.


    Description: The problem studied here is the possibility of conversion between two sets of pure bipartite states by a LOCC transformation. A set of necessary conditions is presented and it is shown by examples that these conditions are independent and not sufficient. Furthermore, it is demonstrated by examples that the sets of transformations LOCC SEPP PPT ALL are separated by transformation problems of this type.

    This is an important and relevant problem, but the presented necessary conditions seem quite straightforward. The particular examples separating the conditions and the set of transformations may be interesting and provide some insight, but it does not seem to be sufficient for a talk.

1. Alexander Streltsov. Catalytic and asymptotic equivalence for quantum entanglement (41)

    Authors: Ray Ganardi, Tulja Varun Kondra, and Alexander Streltsov 

    Notes:

    - asymptotic LOCC transformation rate, distillable entanglement, entanglement entropy  
    - $\psi$ reducible into $\phi$ if the rate is at least 1   
    - entanglement catalysis: $\psi\otimes \eta \to \psi\otimes \eta$ (LOCC), $\psi,\eta,\psi$ entangled states    
    - approximate catalysis - for bipartite pure states is fully equivalent to reducibility (?)   
    - correlated catalysis - approximate catalysis, some correlations with the catalyst are possible   
    - marginal reducibility 

    Description: For LOCC transformation of bipartite states, the notions of marginal reducibility and correlated catalysis is introduced. What is different to the usual notions is that here some correlations are allowed to be established through the process 
    and the catalyst and the target state are obtained (resp. approximated) as marginals. For distillable states, it is proved  these two concepts are equivalent and that catalysis cannot increase distillable entanglement. 

    It is not very clear from the formulations of the main results in the  abstract that here the notions with correlations are meant. Nevertheless, the result might be important and interesting enough to be presented as a talk.

1. Bihalan Bhattacharya. Detecting entanglement harnessing Lindblad structure (56)

    Authors: Vaibhav Chimalgi, Bihalan Bhattacharya, Suchetana Goswami and Samyadeb Bhattacharya

    Notes:

    - construction of positive maps - entanglement witnesses
    - constructon using Lindblad structure
    - one-parameter family of generalizations of the qubit and qutrit transpose map, and Choi map    
    - usefulness of such maps is not clear from the abstract


    Description: Positive maps (entanglement witnesses) are constructed using the Lindblad structure of dynamical maps. 
    Some families of positive but non completely positive maps are obtained in this way, extending some known maps such as the 
qubit and qutrit transpose maps and Choi maps. 

    Usefulness of such maps as entanglement witnesses is not clearly described or argued for in the abstract. The construction may be nice, but more suitable for presentation as a poster.

1. Mirjam Weilenmann. Optimisation of time-ordered processes in the finite and asymptotic regime (60)

    Authors: Mirjam Weilenmann, Costantino Budroni, and Miguel Navascu ́es

    Notes: 

    - optimization of sequential protocols
    - sequential models: a class of time-ordered processes
    - device certification, finite state automata
    - performance of SM in N rounds: a hierarchy of convex optimization problems, new technique (?)
    -examples: many-body entanglement detection (combination with polynomial opt.), temporal correlations in automata - optimal clocks
    - asymptotic regime, undecidability results imply that there are models such that no algorithm can approximate the asymptotic behavious
    - upper and lower bounds
    - usefulness - solving an open problem
    - pozriet!


    Description: General techniques are introduced to analyse and optimise over sequential processes, both in finite and asymptotic regimes. These techniques allow to solve optimalization problems that were not tractable by previous methods and are applicable in the context of device certification and for optimalization over finite state automata. The usefulness of the methods is illustrated on examoles of many-body entanglement detection and on the study of temporal correlation created by finite state automata. 


    These are important results of overall interest and clearly deserve presentation as a talk.

1. Michał Banacki. Security based on extremality - channel steering with information leakage  (65)   

    Authors: . Banacki, R. Ramanathan, P. Horodecki

    Notes: 


    Description: This submission is dealing with post-quantum steering of quantum channels. For this, multipartite channel steering is introduced and it is shown that, as in the case of states, post-quantum steering exists for the case of more than 1 untrusted party. It is shown that in this setting, extremal assemblages of channels exists which are quantum and non-local, which is then applied for a construction of a cryptographic key that is secure against post-quantum resorces.


    By the use of the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, the setting of channel steering is directly related to the case of states. So these results do not seem so surprising, given the known results for states. Although the topic is of importance and interest for the audience, it does not seem strong enough to be accepted as a talk.

1. Remigiusz Augusiak. Constructing Bell inequalities for multipartite graph states (74)


    Authors: R. Augusiak

    Notes: Bell inequalities, graph states, self-testing

    Description: Bell inequalities are constructed that are maximally violated by multipartite  graph states. This can be used for self-testing of graph states, the results can be also extended to stabilizer subspaces. This is an interesting and important topic relevant for the CEQIP audience and could be a nice talk.

1. Ryszard Kostecki. Br\`{e}gman entropic projections and nonexpansive operators: probabilistic, quantum, and beyond
    

    Authors: Ryszard Kostecki

    Notes: 

    - extension of Bregman divergences to non-reflexive Banach spaces by embeddings to reflexive
    - applied to preduals of operator algebras
    - categories and monoids of non-linear  onexpansive operators
    - non-linear post-quantum resource theories

    Description: In this submission, the idea of inductive inference by constrained relative entropy maximalization is extended to Bregman divergences, which have nice properties on reflexive Banach spaces. By extending Bregman divergences to non-reflexive case, this idea is generalized to arbitrary infinite-dimensional operator algebraic and even post-quantum settings. As an application, categories of nonexpansive operators are constructed, which gives rise to nonlinear (post)quantum resource theories.

    These might be important and fruitful ideas, but it is not clear from the present abstract how relevant these ideas are for the CEQIP audience.
