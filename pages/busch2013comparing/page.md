## Abstract 
  We introduce a new way of quantifying the degrees of incompatibility of two
ob- servables in a probabilistic physical theory and, based on this, a global
measure of the degree of incompatibility inherent in such theories, across all
observable pairs. This opens up a novel and flexible way of comparing
probabilistic theories with respect to the nonclassical feature of
incompatibility, raising many interesting questions, some of which will be
answered here. We show that quantum theory contains observables that are as
incompatible as any probabilistic physical theory can have if arbitrary pairs
of observables are considered. If one adopts a more refined measure of the
degree of incompatibility, for instance, by restricting the comparison to
binary observables, it turns out that there are probabilistic theories whose
inherent degree of incompatibility is greater than that of quantum mechanics.
