* [Tensor products of DEA](/static/pdf/tpdea.pdf):

 An effect algebra tensor product of dimension effect algebras (DEA) is a DEA. 

* [Tensor product of finite MV-algebras](/static/pdf/tensor.pdf) is a finite MV-algebra.

The proof of this fact is rewritten.

* [Real interval as DEA](/static/pdf/interval.pdf):

The interval $[0,1]$ in $\mathbb R$ as a direct limit of finite MV-algebras.

* Notes from the discussion with Sylvia and Gejza: 
 
There is an adjunction between the categories EA and POA-groups  with order unit, the unigroup functor is the left adjoint, taking unit interval the right.
The unit $\eta_E$ is an isomorphism iff $E$ is an interval effect algebra.

The two definitions of [tensor product of EAs](/static/pdf/tpea.jpg)) 


## Ideas

1. What about tensor product of interval EAs?
1. Tensor product of dimension effect algebras is the unit interval in the tensor products of their universal groups. For $\mathbb R[0,1]$, this is as below.
1. The effect algebra tensor product   $[0,1]\otimes [0,1]$ can be identified as follows:  Take $\mathbb R$ as a vector space over $\mathbb Q$ and take the tensor product $\mathbb R\otimes_{\mathbb Q}\mathbb R$, with the smallest cone such that it becomes a partially ordered abelian group such that the tensor product of positive elements is positive.  Take the interval $[0,1\otimes 1]$ in this ordered group.
