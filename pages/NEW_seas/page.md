We should start by reading this:

* [wetering2020commutativity](wetering2020commutativity) unit interval in a JB-algebra is a SEA

* [hanche1984jordan](BOOK_hanche1984jordan) some basic theory of Jordan and JB algebras

* [stormer1979positive](stormer1979positive) Positive projections and Jordan structure in operator algebras

* [effros stormer 1965](NEW_seas/effros_stormer_JC.pdf)  a paper on Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators

* [kadison1952ageneralized](kadison1952ageneralized) Kadison-Schwarz inequality    



Some notes:

* [notes](NEW_seas/posproj.pdf) on the results of [stormer1979positive](stormer1979positive) generalized to JB-algebras    
* hand-written [notes](NEW_seas/projections.pdf) on the structure of positive unital (normal) projections on JB(W)-algebras
