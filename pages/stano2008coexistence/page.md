## Abstract 
  We characterize all coexistent pairs of qubit effects. This gives an
exhaustive description of all pairs of events allowed, in principle, to occur
in a single qubit measurement. The characterization consists of three disjoint
conditions which are easy to check for a given pair of effects. Known special
cases are shown to follow from our general characterization theorem.
