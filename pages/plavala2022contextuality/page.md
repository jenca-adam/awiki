## Abstract 
  Quantum theory features several phenomena which can be considered as
resources for information processing tasks. Some of these effects, such as
entanglement, arise in a non-local scenario, where a quantum state is
distributed between different parties. Other phenomena, such as contextuality
can be observed, if quantum states are prepared and then subjected to sequences
of measurements. Here we provide an intimate connection between different
resources by proving that entanglement in a non-local scenario can only arise
if there is preparation & measurement contextuality in a sequential scenario
derived from the non-local one by remote state preparation. Moreover, the
robust absence of entanglement implies the absence of contextuality. As a
direct consequence, our result allows to translate any inequality for testing
preparation & measurement contextuality into an entanglement test; in addition,
entanglement witnesses can be used to obtain novel contextuality inequalities.
