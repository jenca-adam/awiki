This paper investigates and clarifies the connection between geometric and estimation-theoretic properties of a quantum statistical model. More precisely, for classical statistical models, existence of efficient estimators is determined in terms of a pair of specific affine connections that are dual with respect to a Riemannian metric given by the Fisher information matrix. In the case of models consisting of finite dimensional quantum states, the corresponding geometric structures were developed, but the relation to efficient estimators holds only partially: the geometric condition is necessary but not sufficient for existence of such an estimator.

The present paper completes this picture, showing that the geometric properties are equivalent to some weaker conditions: existence of an efficient filtration of estimators, or existence of efficient estimators for scalar valued functions forming a subspace of maximal dimension (equivalently, for the individual parameters). Further geometric characterizations are given and two specific examples are considered: the Gaussian shift model and the manifold of qubit states.

This is an important step towards understanding of the relation between geometric and statistical properties of quantum statistical models. The paper is nicely written and understandable even without giving too many technical details on the differential-geometrical structures. I have only few very minor comments:

- In propositions 2.3. and 2.4., it is not clear from the formulation (although it becomes clear from the context) whether the connection is given on M or on S.

- I got a bit confused in the evaluation of the LHS in the last line on p. 21. Is \xi^i(\rho) a constant here? Similarly f(\rho) in the displayed equation on p. 27, line 6 from below. It would be perhaps better to explain it.

- Sec. 6, For a treatment of Gaussian models, it might be possible to use the geometric structure described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09396. (This is just a suggestion, I am not sure that it would be useful).
