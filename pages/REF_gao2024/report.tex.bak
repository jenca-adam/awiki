\bigskip

The aim of the paper is a characterization of recoverability of quantum channels through
the quantum Fisher information. More precisely, a quantum Fisher information is defined as
a Riemannian metric on the manifold of density matrices of full rank,  which is
nonincreasing under quantum channels. For a large class of such metrics, called regular in
the paper, it is shown that preservation of the metric is equivalent to sufficiency of the
channels for the given parametrized family of states (that is, the channel is reversible
on thsi family). The most commonly known quantum
Fisher information, the SLD QFI, does not have this property. The approximate case is also
treated and recoverability bounds are given in terms of the QFI. Similar questions are studied for the closely related $\chi^2$-divergences.  Some applications to quantum thermodynamics and the resource theory of asymmetry
are discussed.

\textbf{Overall evaluation}

\medskip
 There is a number of works dealing with  recoverability of channels and its characterization
by decrease of the relative entropy or other divergences and related quantities. The question whether a similar
characterization can be achieved by the quantum Fisher information is a very natural one.
The paper is well written and easy to read, the proofs are clearly explained and correct. 
I would have no doubts to recommend its publication to a high quality journal. But I am
not entirely convinced that the present results are significant and strong 
enough to  meet the standards of Communications in Mathematical Physics. I give a brief
description of the results below.

\textbf{A more detailed descripton}

\medskip

The equality case, that is the exact recoverability or sufficiency of a channel, has been
treated before in the cited paper [Jen12], at least for the $\chi^2$-divergences or
linearly parametrized families of states. The present paper generalizes this result to
arbitrary (smoothly) parametrized families of full rank states (Theorem 5.2). The example showing that
the SLD  QFI does not characterize sufficiency of channels also comes from
the ideas in [Jen12]. 

The approximate case is more tricky, and seems to be treated for the first time here. In
Sec. 4, the difference  $\gamma_\rho(A)-\gamma_{\Phi(\rho)}(\Phi(A))$ for a strongly
regular monotone metric $\gamma$ and a channel $\Phi$ gives an upper bound on $\|A-\mathcal
R^t_{\rho,\Phi}(\Phi(A))\|_1$, here $\mathcal
R^t_{\rho,\Phi}$ is the rotated Petz map that serves as a universal recovery map in the
exact case. This bound is obtained from the integral representation of the operator
(anti)monotone function and follows an idea somewhat similar to the one used for
quasi-entropies in the paper arXiv:1710.08080 by E. Carlen and  A. Vershynina
(this paper was not cited in the manuscript, but I think just by mistake).
Usefulness of the general bound obtained in Lemma 4.4 is not immediately
clear, but from there  some more practically looking  bounds are obtained in the special
cases of the BKM (Cor. 4.6) and the $x^\alpha$-metrics (Cor. 4.7). These bounds are far from universal, in fact,
the only universal bound is found in Sec. 4.2 for the $x^{\frac12}$-metric, which is a nice result.
It is obtained in a quite different way, and it is not compared to the one comming from
Corollary 4.7 (which is probably quite far from that of Theorem 4.9). Optimality
questions for  the obtained bounds are not discussed.

In Sec. 5, a recoverability result for a smooth 1-dimensional family of states
is obtained by bounding the decrease in the relative entropy by that of the  BKM metric,
essentially using the fact that the BKM metric can be defined by differentiation of the
relative entropy. In Secs. 1.6 and 6, the equality results are applied to show existence
of a time-translation invariant or a covariant recovery map by equality in the Fisher
information matrix.

\textbf{Some minor specific comments}


\begin{enumerate}
\item p. 8, lines 55-60: $L(\theta)$  or $L_\theta$?
\item p. 9, first sentence (''Note that...''): check the conditions on the supports,
for example, if $\rho_\theta$ is invertible, then
clearly $\mathrm{supp}(|\dot\rho_\theta|)\subseteq \mathrm{supp}(\rho_\theta)$ but
$I_{RLD}$ is finite.
\item p. 9, line 22-23: $\mathcal L_{\theta_o}$ should be $\mathcal L_o$ (twice)
\item p. 10, line 41-42: ''One problem remains open...'' from Remark 3.7 it seems to
follow that the answer is no(?). 
\item p. 13, Lemma 4.1: $\Phi(\rho)$ might be singular, so $A$ should be restricted
\item p. 16, line 44: ''Right operator mean metric'' perhaps RLD?
\item p. 23, Remark 5.4: reference to Eq.(5.2) maybe there should be (5.1)?
\item References [CV20a] and [CV20b] are the same. Maybe [CV20b] should be to another
paper by Carlen and Vershynina (mentioned above)?
