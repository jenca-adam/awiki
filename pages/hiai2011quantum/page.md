## Abstract 
  Quantum f-divergences are a quantum generalization of the classical notion of
f-divergences, and are a special case of Petz' quasi-entropies. Many well known
distinguishability measures of quantum states are given by, or derived from,
f-divergences; special examples include the quantum relative entropy, the Renyi
relative entropies, and the Chernoff and Hoeffding measures. Here we show that
the quantum f-divergences are monotonic under the dual of Schwarz maps whenever
the defining function is operator convex. This extends and unifies all
previously known monotonicity results. We also analyze the case where the
monotonicity inequality holds with equality, and extend Petz' reversibility
theorem for a large class of f-divergences and other distinguishability
measures. We apply our findings to the problem of quantum error correction, and
show that if a stochastic map preserves the pairwise distinguishability on a
set of states, as measured by a suitable f-divergence, then its action can be
reversed on that set by another stochastic map that can be constructed from the
original one in a canonical way. We also provide an integral representation for
operator convex functions on the positive half-line, which is the main
ingredient in extending previously known results on the monotonicity inequality
and the case of equality. We also consider some special cases where the
convexity of f is sufficient for the monotonicity, and obtain the inverse
Holder inequality for operators as an application. The presentation is
completely self-contained and requires only standard knowledge of matrix
analysis.
