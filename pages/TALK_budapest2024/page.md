* **Event:** Focused Workshop on Quantum Rényi Divergences   
* **Date:** 07/22/2024 - 07/26/2024    
* **Place:** Erdos Center, Budapest
* **Title:** On $\alpha-z$-Rényi divergences in von Neumann algebras

* **Abstract:**  The $\alpha-z$-Rényi divergences form a family of quantum extensions of the classical Rényi
divergences, which are fundamental in information theory. This family interpolates between the two well established quantum extensions: the Petz-type and the sandwiched Rényi divergences. Recently, the $\alpha-z$-Rényi divergences were extended to the general setting of von Neumann algebras. In this talk, some properties of this extension  will be shown,  with focus on the data processing inequality and reversibility of quantum 
channels. Reversibility and equality in DPI  will be also discussed in the case when only positivity of the maps is assumed. The talk is based on a joint work with Fumio Hiai.
