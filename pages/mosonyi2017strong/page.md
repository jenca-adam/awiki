## Abstract 
  We determine the exact strong converse exponent of classical-quantum channel
coding, for every rate above the Holevo capacity. Our form of the exponent is
an exact analogue of Arimoto's, given as a transform of the Renyi capacities
with parameters alpha>1. It is important to note that, unlike in the classical
case, there are many inequivalent ways to define the Renyi divergence of
states, and hence the Rényi capacities of channels. Our exponent is in terms
of the Renyi capacities corresponding to a version of the Renyi divergences
that has been introduced recently in [Müller-Lennert, Dupuis, Szehr, Fehr and
Tomamichel, J. Math. Phys. 54, 122203, (2013)], and [Wilde, Winter, Yang,
Commun. Math. Phys. 331, (2014)]. Our result adds to the growing body of
evidence that this new version is the natural definition for the purposes of
strong converse problems.
