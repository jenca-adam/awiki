## Abstract 
  We prove the converse part of the theorem for quantum Hoeffding bound on the
asymptotics of quantum hypothesis testing, essentially based on an argument
developed by Nussbaum and Szkola in proving the converse part of the quantum
Chernoff bound. Our result complements Hayashi's proof of the direct
(achievability) part of the theorem, so that the quantum Hoeffding bound has
now been established.
