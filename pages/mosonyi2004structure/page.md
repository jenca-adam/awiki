## Abstract 
  Let H and K be Hilbert spaces and T be a coarse-graining from B(H) to B(K).
Assume that density matrices D_1 and D_2 acting on H are given. In the paper
the consequences of the existence of a coarse-graining S from B(K) to B(H)
satisfying ST(D_1)=D_1 and ST(D_2)=D_2 are given. (This condition means the
sufficiency of T for D_1 and D_2.) Sufficiency implies a particular
decomposition of the density matrices. This decomposition allows to deduce the
exact condition for equality in the strong subadditivity of the von Neumann
entropy.
