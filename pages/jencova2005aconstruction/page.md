## Abstract 

Abstract:  We present a construction of a Banach manifold on the set of faithful normal
states of a von Neumann algebra, where the underlying Banach space is a quantum
analogue of an Orlicz space. On the manifold, we introduce the exponential and
mixture connections as dual pair of affine connections.
