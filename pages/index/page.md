## My projects


### Quantum comparison: experiments, channels, networks

* [Quantum relative entropies, channels and sufficiency](PROJECT_qre) (finishing)

* [Quantum channels equivalence](PROJECT_channel_equivalence) (new)
 
* [Comparison](PROJECT_comparison) (finishing)

* [Channels, subalgebras, decoherence](PROJECT_decoherence) (finished for now, further ideas)


### General probabilistic theories (GPT)

* [GPT](PROJECT_gpt)

### Some categorial stuff

* [NC category](PROJECT_nc) (slow progress)

* [The state-effect monad](state-effect) (killed)


### Effect algebras
