## Abstract 
We develop rigorous notions of causality and causal separability in the process framework introduced in [Oreshkov, Costa, Brukner, Nat. Commun. 3, 1092 (2012)], which describes correlations between separate local experiments without a prior assumption of causal order between them. We consider the general multipartite case and take into account the possibility for dynamical causal order, where the order of a set of events can depend on other events in the past. Starting from a general definition of causality, we derive an iteratively formulated canonical decomposition of multipartite causal processes, and show that for a fixed number of settings and outcomes for each party, the respective correlations form a polytope whose facets define causal inequalities. In the case of quantum processes, we investigate the link between causality and the theory-dependent notion of causal separability, which we here extend to the multipartite case based on concrete principles. We show that causality and causal separability are not equivalent in general by giving an example of a physically admissible tripartite quantum process that is causal but not causally separable. We also show that there exist causally separable (and hence causal) quantum processes that become non-causal if extended by supplying the parties with entangled ancillas. This example of activation of non-causality motivates the concepts of extensibly causal and extensibly causally separable (ECS) processes, for which the respective property remains invariant under extension with arbitrary ancillas. We characterize the class of tripartite ECS processes in terms of simple conditions on the form of the process matrix, which generalize the form of bipartite causally separable process matrices. We show that the processes realizable by classically controlled quantum circuits are ECS and conjecture that the reverse also holds.
