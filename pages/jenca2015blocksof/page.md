## Abstract 

Abstract:  Effect algebras, introduced by Foulis and Bennett in 1994, are partial
algebras which generalize some well known classes of algebraic structures (for
example orthomodular lattices, MV algebras, orthoalgebras etc.). In the present
paper, we introduce a new class of effect algebras, called {\em homogeneous
effect algebras}. This class includes orthoalgebras, lattice ordered effect
algebras and effect algebras satisfying Riesz decomposition property. We prove
that every homogeneous effect algebra is a union of its blocks, which we define
as maximal sub-effect algebras satisfying Riesz decomposition property. This
generalizes a recent result by Riečanová, in which lattice ordered effect
algebras were considered. Moreover, the notion of a block of a homogeneous
effect algebra is a generalization of the notion of a block of an orthoalgebra.
We prove that the set of all sharp elements in a homogeneous effect algebra $E$
forms an orthoalgebra $E_S$. Every block of $E_S$ is the center of a block of
$E$. The set of all sharp elements in the compatibility center of $E$ coincides
with the center of $E$. Finally, we present some examples of homogeneous effect
algebras and we prove that for a Hilbert space $\mathbb H$ with $dim(\mathbb
H)>1$, the standard effect algebra $\mathcal E(\mathbb H)$ of all effects in
$\mathbb H$ is not homogeneous.
