## Abstract 
  Compressions on an effect algebra $E$, analogous to compressions on operator
algebras, order unit spaces or unital abelian groups, are studied. A special
family of compressions on $E$ is called a compression base. Elements of a
compression base are in one-to-one correspondence with certain elements of $E$,
called projections. A compression base is spectral if it has two special
properties: the projection cover property (i.e., for every element $a$ in $E$
there is a smallest projection majorizing $a$), and the so-called
b-comparability property, which is an analogue of general comparability in
operator algebras or unital abelian groups. An effect algebra is called
spectral if it has a distinguished spectral compression base. It is shown that
in a spectral effect algebra $E$, every $a\in E$ admits a unique rational
spectral resolution and its properties are studied. If in addition $E$
possesses a separating set of states, then every element $a\in E$ is determined
by its spectral resolution. It is also proved that for some types of interval
effect algebras (with RDP, Archimedean divisible), spectrality of $E$ is
equivalent to spectrality of its universal group and the corresponding rational
spectral resolutions are the same. In particular, for convex Archimedean effect
algebras, spectral resolutions in $E$ are in agreement with spectral
resolutions in the corresponding order unit space.
