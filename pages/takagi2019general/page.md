## Contents

* Convex resource theories for states, measurements and channels in GPT

* Resource measures: generalized robustness (for measurements, states and channels), standard robustness for states - operational interpretation in terms of discrimination tasks

* resource manipulation: state/channel discrimination tasks form complete families of monotones: given a set $\mathcal
  O$ of channels (everything on a  *fixed* state space):

     * for a pair of states $\omega$, $\omega'$, $\omega'=\Lambda(\omega)$ for some $\Lambda\in \mathcal O$ is
       characterized using success probabilities in channel discrimination tasks for ensembles in $\mathcal O$ (Thm. 9,
       Coro. 10 \& 11) or for general channel ensembles with preprocessings from $\mathcal O$ (Thm. 12, Coro. 13).

     * for a pair of measurements $M$, $M'$, $M'=\Lambda^*(M)$ for  some $\Lambda\in \mathcal O$  is
       characterized using success probabilities in state discrimination tasks with possible preprocessing from
       $\mathcal O$ (Thm. 14)

     * for two sets of states $\\{\sigma_i\\}\_{i=0}^{N-1}$, $\\{\sigma'_i\\}\_{i=0}^{N-1}$,  $\sigma_i'=\Lambda(\sigma_i)$ for all $i$ and some $\Lambda\in \mathcal O$ is characterized by success probabilities for the  ensembles
     $\\{p_i,\sigma_i\\}$ and  $\\{p_i,\sigma'_i\\}$ by discrimination with preprocessing from $\mathcal O$ (Coro. 15). 

     * In Thm. 9 and Thm. 12, either all possible distributions $\{p_i\}$ in the ensembles and usual
       measurements, or a fixed distribution and all inconclusive measurements $\sum_i M_i\le I$ are used 

     * the proofs use *minimax theorem*.
