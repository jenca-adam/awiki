## Abstract 
  The concept of steering was introduced by Schrodinger in 1935 as a
generalization of the EPR paradox for arbitrary pure bipartite entangled states
and arbitrary measurements by one party. Until now, it has never been
rigorously defined, so it has not been known (for example) what mixed states
are steerable (that is, can be used to exhibit steering). We provide an
operational definition, from which we prove (by considering Werner states and
Isotropic states) that steerable states are a strict subset of the entangled
states, and a strict superset of the states that can exhibit Bell-nonlocality.
For arbitrary bipartite Gaussian states we derive a linear matrix inequality
that decides the question of steerability via Gaussian measurements, and we
relate this to the original EPR paradox.
