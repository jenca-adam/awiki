## Abstract 
  We find optimality conditions for testers in discrimination of quantum
channels. These conditions are obtained using semidefinite programming and are
similar to optimality conditions for POVMs obtained by Holevo for ensembles of
quantum states. We get a simple condition for existence of an optimal tester
with any given input state with maximal Schmidt rank, in particular with a
maximally entangled input state and we show the pitfalls of using input states
with not maximal Schmidt rank. In case when maximally entangled state is not
the optimal input state an error estimate is obtained. The results for
maximally entangled input state are applied to covariant channels, qubit
channels, unitary channels and simple projective measurements.
