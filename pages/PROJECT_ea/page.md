## Tensor products of effect algebras

**People:**  Sylvia, Gejza    
**Directory:** /work/dimension


**Notes and ideas:**

* Notes from the discussion with Sylvia and Gejza:     
 There is an adjunction between the categories EA and POA-groups  with order unit, the unigroup functor is the left adjoint, taking unit interval the right.
The unit $\eta_E$ is an isomorphism iff $E$ is an interval effect algebra.

* What about tensor product of interval EAs? Maybe RDP.
