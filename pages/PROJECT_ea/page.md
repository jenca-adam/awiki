## Spectral effect algebras 

### Spectral EA: Foulis vs.Alfsen-Schultz

* Rickart JB-algebras are (Foulis) spectral

### Spectral EA in the sense of Gudder

**People:** Martin    
**Directory:**/work/context

* Gudder spectral effect algebras in finite dimensions  [gudder2018convex](gudder2018convex)  
* Main question: number of context in spectral EAs    
* Answer: one or infinitely many
* Some examples (Alfsen-Schultz spectral convex sets in finite dimensions)

## Tensor products of effect algebras

**People:**  Sylvia, Gejza    
**Directory:** /work/dimension


**Notes and ideas:**

* [Tensor product of spectral effect algebras](tpdea/note_tensorMV.pdf) is a spectral EA. The proof of this fact is rewritten. <span style="color:green"> **added to Main draft**</span>

* Notes from the discussion with Sylvia and Gejza:     
 There is an adjunction between the categories EA and POA-groups  with order unit, the unigroup functor is the left adjoint, taking unit interval the right.
The unit $\eta_E$ is an isomorphism iff $E$ is an interval effect algebra.

* What about tensor product of interval EAs? Maybe RDP.
