"This submission deals with the problem of compression of N copies of states that are generated from n qubits by circuits of bounded depth.
The paper focuses on the case of brickwork shallow circuits. A faithful N-copy compression protocol is presented that uses a hybrid quantum-classical memory, with memory cost linear in n and logarithmic in N. It is also proved that the protocol is optimal with respect to the memory cost. 

The paper is technically quite complicated, consisting in several approximation steps each of which is rather convoluted and it is necessary to carefully keep track of the ensuing errors. The studied problem is rather specific, and the resulting protocol is not computationally eficient. Nevertheless, the proposed techniques might be of wider use and would be  interesting for the audience  if the main concepts and ideas are presented clearly.
