## Abstract 
  The existence of maximally incompatible quantum observables in the sense of a
minimal joint measurability region is investigated. Employing the universal
quantum cloning device it is argued that only infinite dimensional quantum
systems can accommodate maximal incompatibility. It is then shown that two of
the most common pairs of complementary observables (position and momentum;
number and phase) are maximally incompatible.

### Content

* Maximal incompatibility of quantum observables (joint incompatibility region [busch2013comparing](busch2013comparing) of two observables $A$, $B$, is the minimal set) iff the compatibility degree $j(A,B)=1/2$.

* Lower bound on the compatibility degree for a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space:
\[
\frac{2+d}{2(1+d)}\le j(A,B)
\]

* the lower bound is obtained using an approximate cloning device

* Conclusion: maximal incomaptibility in quantum systems can (and does) exist only in infinite dimensions
