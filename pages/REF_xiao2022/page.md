Description: In this Supplemental Material, we provide more detailed analysis and proofs of the results presented in the main text. Furthermore, a strengthened entropic uncertainty relation has also been offered. For this purpose, some basic knowledge of majorization lattice, including the construction of flatness process, has been supplied. Focusing on the families of maximal common-cause and direct-cause indicators, we develop a fundamental trade-off relation on causal dependencies of quantum dynamics. We demonstrate our results through applications to quantum causal inference. Numerical experiments have also been provided. Finally, it is worth noting that we may reiterate some of the steps in the main text to make the Supplemental Material more explicit and self-contained.

**Decision:**  accept (my decision)
