## Abstract 

The aim of this book is to develop "from the ground up" many of the major,
exciting, pre- and post-millenium developments in the general area of study
known as quantum Shannon theory. As such, we spend a significant amount of time
on quantum mechanics for quantum information theory (Part II), we give a
careful study of the important unit protocols of teleportation, super-dense
coding, and entanglement distribution (Part III), and we develop many of the
tools necessary for understanding information transmission or compression (Part
IV). Parts V and VI are the culmination of this book, where all of the tools
developed come into play for understanding many of the important results in
quantum Shannon theory.
