## Abstract 
  We introduce quantum XOR games, a model of two-player one-round games that
extends the model of XOR games by allowing the referee's questions to the
players to be quantum states. We give examples showing that quantum XOR games
exhibit a wide range of behaviors that are known not to exist for standard XOR
games, such as cases in which the use of entanglement leads to an arbitrarily
large advantage over the use of no entanglement. By invoking two deep
extensions of Grothendieck's inequality, we present an efficient algorithm that
gives a constant-factor approximation to the best performance players can
obtain in a given game, both in case they have no shared entanglement and in
case they share unlimited entanglement. As a byproduct of the algorithm we
prove some additional interesting properties of quantum XOR games, such as the
fact that sharing a maximally entangled state of arbitrary dimension gives only
a small advantage over having no entanglement at all.
