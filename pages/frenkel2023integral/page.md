## Abstract 
  Integral representations of quantum relative entropy, and of the directional
second and higher order derivatives of von Neumann entropy, are established,
and used to give simple proofs of fundamental, known data processing
inequalities: the Holevo bound on the quantity of information transmitted by a
quantum communication channel, and, much more generally, the monotonicity of
quantum relative entropy under trace-preserving positive linear maps --
complete positivity of the map need not be assumed. The latter result was first
proved by Müller-Hermes and Reeb, based on work of Beigi.
In the last section, we consider any `divergence' that is non-increasing
under quantum measurements, such as the concavity of von Neumann entropy, or
various known quantum divergences. An elegant argument due to Hiai, Ohya, and
Tsukada is used to show that the infimum of such a `divergence' on pairs of
quantum states with prescribed trace distance is the same as the corresponding
infimum on pairs of binary classical states.
