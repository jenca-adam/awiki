## Abstract 
  A generalized pseudo effect algebra (GPEA) is a partially ordered partial
algebraic structure with a smallest element 0, but not necessarily with a unit
(i.e, a largest element). If a GPEA admits a so-called unitizing automorphism,
then it can be embedded as an order ideal in its so-called unitization, which
does have a unit. We study unitizations of GPEAs with respect to a unitizing
automorphism, paying special attention to the behavior of congruences and
ideals in this setting.
