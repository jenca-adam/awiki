## Abstract 
Two different characterizations of POV measures with commutative range are compared using a representation of some stochastic operators by (weak) Markov kernels. A representation by Choquet theorem is obtained as an integral over functions of a sharp observable appearing in one of the characterizations. A Naimark extension is constructed.
