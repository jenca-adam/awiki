## Abstract 

Abstract:  We show how the known theory of noncommutative Orlicz spaces for semifinite
von Neumann algebras equipped with an fns trace, may be recovered using crossed
product techniques. Then using this as a template, we construct analogues of
such spaces for type III algebras. The constructed spaces naturally dovetail
with and closely mimic the behaviour of Haagerup $L^p$-spaces. We then define a
modified $K$-method of interpolation which seems to better fit the present
context, and give a formal prescription for using this method to define what
may be regarded as type III Riesz-Fischer spaces.
