1. [All Euclidean Jordan algebras are sequential](wetering2018three) effect algebras (which are also spectral) and 
[sequential product spaces are Jordan algebras](wetering2018sequential), which means in particular that they are spectral. In particular, the spin-factors form a class of non-quantum spectral effect algebras.
1. If you can find some condition for finding a spectral theorem for states, then this answers all questions 2,5,6. This can for
instance be done using the notion of self-duality.
1.  In ["Geometry of State spaces and operator algebras"](BOOK_alfsen2003geometry) they define the notion of a "spectral convex set" that in finite dimension I think is roughly the same as a spectral effect algebra (although maybe a bit stronger). In particular in Theorem 8.87 they give a construction for a class of 'pathological' spectral convex sets.  think in the main example they give there is a context with 2 elements and a context with 3 elements.
1. Do all sequential effect algebras - by your result all Euclidean Jordan Algebras - have the same cardinality of contexts? 
When my theorem applies the answer is yes. The conditions for when it applies do have a few caveats though (only works for order unit spaces that are finite dimensional and for which the sequential product is norm-continuous in the first argument). The exact reason for the cardinality being the same is that the lattice of sharp effects is an atomic lattice with 'the covering property'. You can find more on the covering property in the works of Alfsen and Schultz.
1. If you can find a spectral order unit space where the contexts have different cardinalities, then the lattice can't have the covering property, so that the sharp effects don't correspond to a projective geometry, and hence the sharp effects don't really correspond to 'projections' of subspaces of the order unit space.
1. One way in which you do get an interesting duality is the assumption of what Alfsen and Schultz call 'symmetry of transition probabilities'. 
1. Another way you might find examples of spectral order unit spaces that don't allow a sequential product is by looking at non-self-dual homogeneous cones.
