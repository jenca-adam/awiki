title: Preorder and equivalence of quantum channels
---
*  **Description:** We describe the (post-processing) preorder and equivalence of quantum channels. We use the relation to 
 quantum experiments (sufficiency, randomization preorder and equivalence) and the ideas from comparison.  
*  **People:** M. Sedl√°k   
*  **Related to:** [comparison](PROJECT_comparison)   
*  **Directory:**  work/channels
