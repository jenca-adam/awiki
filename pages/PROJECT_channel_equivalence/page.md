title: Preorder and equivalence of quantum channels
---
*  **Description:** We describe the (post-processing) preorder and equivalence of quantum channels. We use the relation to 
 quantum experiments (sufficiency, randomization preorder and equivalence) and the ideas from comparison.  
*  **People:** M. Sedl√°k   
*  **Related to:** [comparison](PROJECT_comparison) , [sufficiency](PROJECT_qre)
*  **Directory:**  work/channels

### Ideas

* is there any relation to [index](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/194449893.pdf)?  (See also [arxiv:1909.01906](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01906) Gao, Junge, Laracquente: rel. entropy for von Neumann)


* find some description of the ''minimal instrument'' using [Arveson's](arveson1969subalgebras) cp ordering in Heisenberg picture
