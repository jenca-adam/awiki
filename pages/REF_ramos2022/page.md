Report2: I am a bit puzzled about this revision.
The authors did add some explanations and references to the introduction and improved the proof of Thm. 6,
but a large part of Sec. 4 containing some new and potentially interesting examples of qutrit channels disappeared.
The part where construction of rank 4 qutrit maps was removed completely and left for ''future work''.
Only the trivial examples of unitary channels and the (unitary conjugate of the) well known Werner-Holevo channel were left as examples
of extremal qutrit maps in the new family.
As for the new section 6 named ''Convex mixtures UCPT-extreme maps'', it is shown that UCPT maps obtained by convex mixtures of the introduced class of channels
have the Choi matrix of a special block-diagonal form, but this is hardly a characterization of such maps, and is easily obtained from the Choi matrices in the class itself.
No further interpretations of this fact, not even a clearly formulated statement of the results of this section is given.

To conclude, the original manuscript had some potential to be published, but this seems to be removed from the revised version.
