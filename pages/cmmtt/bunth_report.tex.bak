{\large Report on the PhD thesis by Gergely Bunth: \\
On quantum R\'enyi divergences }

\end{center}
\medskip


\bigskip

The thesis is concerned with quantum extensions of R\'enyi divergences, which can be
defined 
as certain quantities on pairs  of quantum states that coincide with the
classical R\'enyi divergence in mutually commuting cases. Of course, such extensions cannot
be arbitrary and the quantities must satisfy certain properties to be potentially useful.
To construct such extensions, essentially two different approaches are taken in the
present thesis. 

The first approach, described in Section 3, is inspired by a variational formula that relates the classical R\'enyi divergence to the weighted (left) radius of two probability functions with respect to the relative entropy
(Kullback-Leibler divergence). This formula can be extended to multivariate
cases and coincides with the Hellinger transform if the weights are given by a probability
distribution. 
In this part of the thesis, an analogical formula is used to define barycentric R\'enyi
divergences for pairs or families of quantum states (or positive semidefinite operators). 
Since there exist many versions of the quantum relative entropy,  a different version  may be used, even for each state,
so that the obtained class of quantities is quite large.  These quantities inherit some useful properies of the defining relative entropies, such as the scaling property or the data processing inequality. It is also proved that 
 the previously known quantum versions of the R\'enyi divergences, that is,  the
$\alpha-z$-divergences, measured or maximal R\'enyi divergences, are not contained in this
class. 

Another approach, described in Section 4, is axiomatic, based on the fact that the
elements in the spectrum of certain ordered semirings constructed from relative
(sub)majorization of families of probability vectors (or vectors of nonnegative numbers)
are obtained from R\'enyi divergences.  The importance of the spectrum lies in the fact
that its elements characterize asymptotic or catalytic majorization in preordered semirings. 
This idea is applied to ordered semirings consisting of  pairs of continuous functions 
$\rho:X\to B(\mathcal H)_{>0}$ and $\sigma: Y\to B(\mathcal H)_{>0}$ from compact Hausdorff spaces to
positive definite operators on a finite dimensional Hilbert space and with preorder given by
relative submajorization with respect to completely positive trace nonincreasing maps. 
In the case when all elements in the range of $\sigma$ commute, the spectrum is fully
characterized in terms of sandwiched R\'enyi divergences with $\alpha>1$, which leads to a
characterization of asymptotic submajorization and a sufficient condition for catalityc
submajorization. In the general
case, some further elements of the spectrum are constructed by composing the sandwiched
R\'enyi divergence with a quantum version of the geometric mean, thus obtaining a set of
necessary conditions.

Applications discussed in the thesis include characterization of the error exponents
in the strong converse regime in the composite hypotesis testing, equivariant relative
subjaoriztion and a description of asymptotic transformations of by thermal
processes, hypothesis testing with group symmetry or with reference frames and  approximate
joint transformations. 

The thesis is based on  three papers, two of which with the coauthor P\'eter Vrana are published in
high quality journals, and a third paper including also the thesis supervisor, which is
essentially accepted for publication. 
Given the established importance of the quantum R\'enyi divergences in quantum information
theory, including quite recent results on the use of related quantities in the
characterization of (asymptotic, approximate or catalytic) convertibility between sets of
classical or quantum states, the topic of the thesis is timely and important. The results of the thesis
are based on original ideas and are rather strong, especially in Sec. 4. The approach of the first part
 gives a very reasonable extension to the case of more than two variables (hence a quantum
 version of the classical Hellinger transform) and even in the two-variable case, the proposed barycentric R\'enyi
divergences introduce a potentially  rich supply of promising  quantities to be explored
further. In any case, the thesis brings an important contribution to the field, with many possible
further applications and follow up research directions. Therefore, I am happy to \textbf{recommend
the thesis to be presented at the departmental defense}.


\medskip

There are a few points where I think the thesis could be improved, these are listed below.
I would like to stress that the suggested improvements concern solely the thesis
presentation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The part of the thesis on barycentric R\'enyi divergences is based on the paper
[MBV23], which starts from a general definition of a (many valued) quantum divergence and
discusses more material than described in the thesis. Some parts of this paper are
contained in the thesis  and some are not, as a consequence, some important definitions seem to be
missing. Some instances are listed below, but it is recommended to check whether there are
some more:

\begin{itemize}
\item a quantum divergence is defined in [MBV23] to be invariant under
isometries, but this property is missing in Definition 2.2.6 of the quantum R\'enyi
divergence. Isometric invariance is a very basic property that any reasonable quantity
should have, so this omission should definitely be amended. Besides, it  is repeatedly
used in proofs. A further  example is Lemma
3.2.1 whose statement makes little sense without a proper definition of a quantum divergence.

\item $\gamma$-weighted versions of some relative
entropies ($D^{\text{meas}}$, $D^{\text{Um}}$) are mentioned at some places, see  Remark 3.1.13, also p.
40, first paragraph of Sec. 3.2.  These quantities are not defined here and the
corresponding places are taken from the paper [MBV23], where the weighted divergences are introduced.

\item p. 43, Remark 3.2.10: $Q_P^{G_P^{D^q}}$ seems to refer to a weighted divergence,
again not defined in the thesis.

\end{itemize}


\item In Sec. 2.2.2, properties of the quantum R\'enyi divergences are often refered to before their
definition in Section 2.2.4. This is  confusing, especially when it concerns some
commonly used expressions  like ''nonnegative'', which is not easy to guess  that
this is actually  some special property to be defined later.  I strongly suggest to rearrange this part. 

\item Example 4.1.4, proof of Prop. 4.2.3, etc: It would be better to define relative majorization and explain its relation to
relative submajorization for states and/or include a reference to [BV1] . 

\item I think a concluding section, with a discussion of possible future directions and
open questions would be appropriate at the end. 


\end{enumerate}




\medskip

Some minor comments and typos:

\begin{itemize}
\item page 6, line 6 from below: the sentence starting with ''In a resource theory...'' is
rather strange. Also ''sates'' -> states
\item p. 7: ''...target operators are only bounds'' this is difficult to understand
\item $\mathcal P_f$ is used to denote two very different things: $\mathcal P_f(\mathcal
I)$ on p. 10 and  the  operator perspective function  on p. 13. Though it should not cause
confusion, a different notation would be better.


\item p.17, first displayed equation: $D_{\alpha,+\infty}...$ in the second line,
$(1-\alpha)$ is missing

\item p. 17, paragraph above Ex. 2.2.11: I think that strict positivity of $D_{\alpha,z}$
is treated in [Mos23], Corollary III.28 only in the case $\alpha>1$

\item p. 20: ''realation''



\item p. 25, Remark 2.2.25: Actually, it is the Hellinger transform of a set of
probability distributions ($P$ is a parameter)


\item p. 28, last paragraph: $\mathcal D_{\mathcal H}(D_P)$ etc, does not seem to be defined before. 



\item p. 29, displayed equations on the top of the page: $V$ and $V^*$ seem missing in
line 3 and 4 of the equations

\item p. 29: ''isomeric''

\item p. 29, definition of ''regular'' $D_\alpha$: here $\kappa_{\rho,\sigma}>0$ has no
meaning

\item p. 34, Theorem 2.3.36, part (ii)(c): $x\succcurlyeq_c y$ (instead of
$ax\succcurlyeq_c ay$)

\item p. 36., Remark 3.1.3: I think $P(x)\le 0$, $x\in \mathcal X$ is not possible, since
$\sum_xP(x)=1$

\item p. 36., Remark 3.1.7, equality for $R_{D^q,left}$: $\omega$ (instead of $\tau$)

\item p. 37, Lemma 3.1.9: Reference to Eq.(3.12) is used repeatedly, but I think it should
be Eq. (3.3)



\item p. 41, line 6 from below: $S^0_+$ should be $S_+$

\item p. 42, last line: ''Lemma 3.2.1...'' perhaps should be ''Lemma 3.2.2''




\item p. 57, line above Def. 4.1.8: ''to subsemiring'' -> two subsemirings (?)

\item top of p. 60, end of the proof of Lemma 4.2.4: better write out that $k=1$ in the
real case and $k=0$  in the tropical case.

\item p. 64, line 2: ''realative''. Also line 3 from below: in one case $\tilde
f(c_1,d_1)$ should be $\tilde f(c_2,d_2)$.

\item p. 65, Eq.(4.8) and the displayed equation above it: $\rho$ should be $\rho(x)$ in
some places

\item p. 66, Prop 4.3.4: $\mathrm{Tr}\, \sigma(y')$ -> $\mathrm{Tr}\, \sigma(y')=1$

\item p. 67, Def. 4.3.5: ''...a collection of maps $M:\bigtimes_{\mathcal H} C(Y,\mathcal
B(\mathcal H)_{>0}\to\bigtimes_{\mathcal H} C(Y',\mathcal
B(\mathcal H)_{>0} $... this makes no sense. I think what you mean is $M=\{M_{\mathcal
H}\}$, where for each $\mathcal H$, $M_{\mathcal H}: C(Y,\mathcal
B(\mathcal H)_{>0})\to C(Y',\mathcal
B(\mathcal H)_{>0})$ (but this is not a map between the products...).

\item p. 69, displayed equations on the top: the inequality sign should be opposite

\item p. 84, Corollary 4.4.21: $\alpha\ge 0$ -> $\alpha\ge 1$  (?)

\item p. 85, Prop. 4.4.23 (i): ''trace-nonincreasing'' - according to the proof, maybe
''trace-preserving''?

\item p. 88: Example 4.4.27: ''Lemma 4.3.16'' is actually a Proposition

\item p. 88 Example 4.4.28 ''...arbitrary an suppose..,'' -> ''and''

\item Ref. [JV18], [FF20] I think these were already published

\item Incomplete references: [MBV23], [MH23a], [FFHT23], [HT23]
