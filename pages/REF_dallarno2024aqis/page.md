For an n-outcome measurement, the testing range is defined as the image of the set of states under the POVM in R^n. In this submission, the testing range is approximated by ellipsoids that are constructed from the POVM. This simplifies the expression for the testing range and allows for comparison of measurements, in the sense of inclusions of the testing ranges. The approximations are tight in some sense and optimal in some cases. Similar results are obtained for analogous ranges defined for sets of quantum states.

These results and the ideas behind the constructions are certainly of value, but the overall significance is not clear to me. What is lacking is the interpretation of the comparison by inclusions of the testing ranges, which seems rather weak. It is related to simulability, in the sense that one measurement can be obtained from the other by application of a channel, only in the case of qubits where the testing range is much simpler, these results are well known. It is also known that one cannot go far beyond the qubit case. So the applicability of the presented results remains unclear.

This submission could be a nice talk if there is a slot free, especialy if the authors explain the ideas behind their constructions. But I think that a poster would be enough to present these results.
