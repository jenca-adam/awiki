## Abstract 
  It is shown that black hole spacetimes in classical Einstein gravity are
characterized by, in addition to their ADM mass $M$, momentum $\vec P$, angular
momentum $\vec J$ and boost charge $\vec K$, an infinite head of
supertranslation hair. The distinct black holes are distinguished by classical
superrotation charges measured at infinity. Solutions with supertranslation
hair are diffeomorphic to the Schwarzschild spacetime, but the diffeomorphisms
are part of the BMS subgroup and act nontrivially on the physical phase space.
It is shown that a black hole can be supertranslated by throwing in an
asymmetric shock wave. A leading-order Bondi-gauge expression is derived for
the linearized horizon supertranslation charge and shown to generate, via the
Dirac bracket, supertranslations on the linearized phase space of gravitational
excitations of the horizon. The considerations of this paper are largely
classical augmented by comments on their implications for the quantum theory.
