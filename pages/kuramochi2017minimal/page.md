## Abstract 

Abstract:  A statistical experiment on a von Neumann algebra is a parametrized family of
normal states on the algebra. This paper introduces the concept of minimal
sufficiency for statistical experiments in such operator algebraic situations.
We define equivalence relations of statistical experiments indexed by a common
parameter set by completely positive or Schwarz coarse-graining and show that
any statistical experiment is equivalent to a minimal sufficient statistical
experiment unique up to normal isomorphism of outcome algebras. We also
establish the relationship between the minimal sufficiency condition for
statistical experiment in this paper and those for subalgebra. These concepts
and results are applied to the concatenation relation for completely positive
channels with general input and outcome von Neumann algebras. In the case of
the quantum-classical channel corresponding to the positive-operator valued
measure (POVM), we prove the equivalence of the minimal sufficient condition
previously proposed by the author and that in this paper. We also give a
characterization of the discreteness of a POVM up to postprocessing equivalence
in terms of the corresponding quantum-classical channel.
