## Abstract 
  We present a general dilation scheme for quantum instruments with continuous
outcome space in finite dimensions, in terms of an indirect POVM measurement
performed on a finite dimensional ancilla. The general result is then applied
to a large class of instruments generated by operator frames, which contains
group-covariant instruments as a particular case, and allows to construct
dilation schemes based on a measurement on the ancilla followed by a
conditional feed-forward operation on the output. In the case of tight operator
frames our construction generalizes quantum teleportation and telecloning,
producing a whole family of generalized teleportation schemes in which the
instrument is realized via a joint POVM at the sender combined with a
conditional feed-forward operation at the receiver.
