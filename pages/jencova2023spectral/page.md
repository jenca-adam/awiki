## Abstract 
  Order unit spaces with comparability and spectrality properties as introduced
by Foulis are studied. We define continuous functional calculus for order unit
spaces with the comparability property and Borel functional calculus for
spectral order unit spaces. Applying the conditions of Alfsen and Schultz, we
characterize order unit spaces with comparability property that are
JB-algebras. We also prove a characterization of Rickart JB-algebras as those
JB-algebras for which every maximal associative subalgebra is monotone
$\sigma$-complete, extending an analogous result of Saitô and Wright for
C\*-algebras.
