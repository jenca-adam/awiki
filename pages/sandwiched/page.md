* extension of the sandwiched Rényi divergences to normal positive linear functionals on a von Neumann algebra for $\alpha>1$
* proof that this is the same as [berta2018renyi](berta2018renyi)
*  Araki relative entropy is monotone under positive trace-preserving maps 
* suffciency of channels by equality in DPI

## Draft

[Rényi Relative Entropies and Noncommutative $L_p$-Spaces II](/static/pdf/renyi_part2.pdf)

* extension of the sandwiched Rényi divergences for $\alpha\in [1/2,1)$
* comparison with BST (a part is now contained in the above)
* sufficiency of channels by equa;lity in DPI also for $\alpha\in (1/2,1)$
