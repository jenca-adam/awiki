## Draft 

[Rényi Relative Entropies and Noncommutative $L_p$-Spaces II](sandwiched/part2.pdf)

* extension of the sandwiched Rényi divergences for $\alpha\in [1/2,1)$
* comparison with BST (a part is now contained in the above)
* sufficiency of channels by equa;lity in DPI also for $\alpha\in (1/2,1)$
