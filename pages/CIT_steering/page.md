## All

* [uola2020quantum](uola2020quantum) a review on steering

* [plavala2021incompatibility](plavala2021incompatibility) steering and contextuality

* [wiseman2007steering](wiseman2007steering) the very basic reference for operational definition    

* [jones2007entanglement](jones2007entanglement) more on the previous


## tldr

* [nguyen2019quantum](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03963) steerability of Bell-diagonal states     
* [nguyen2020some](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03514) some states unsteerable by 2 outcomes are steerable with 3     
* [nguyen2018quantum](https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/24821/7/Nguyen_2018_J._Phys._A__Math._Theor._51_355302.pdf) steerability of states by POVMs    
* [nguyen2018thegeometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09349) quantum steering can be viewed as an inclusion problem in convex geometry    
* [nguyen2016necessary](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03815) steerability of 2-qubit states by geometry
