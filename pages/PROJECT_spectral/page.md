title: Spectrality in order unit spaces and effect algebras
---
*  **Description:** For spectrality in order unit spaces, we compare ther approach of Alfsen-Shultz to that of Foulis.
   In effect algebras, we study spectrality in the sense of Gudder and the approach of Pulmannová.  
*  **People:** Sylvia Pulmannová, Martin Plávala  
*  **Related to:**     
*  **Folder:** /work/spectral, context

## Research



### Notes



### Todo

* rewrite the manuscript!
* Read the decomposition paper by Sylvia and Foulis: [foulis2010type](foulis2010type)!    
* divisibility decopmosition in comparability/spectral ea?    
* spectrality in sequential ea


### Ideas

* divisibility: decoposition for spectral ea, similar to [westerbaan2020thethree](westerbaan2020thethree)    
    - at least for MV-algebras or Riesz EA with comparability?    
    - archimedean+ some completeness assumption: continuous functions (all respecting the distcrete states) on a totally
      disconnected compact Hausdorff space

* sequential ea:     
    - finite dimensional convex should be Jordal algebras, hence spectral [wetering2018sequential](wetering2018sequential), [wetering2018three](wetering2018three)   
    - infinite dim, but still convex: when it os spectral?     
    - convex spectral: when it is sequential? May be related to Jornal algebras, see the conditions in [alfsen1979onnoncommutative](alfsen1979onnoncommutative)     
    - what can be said in the general case? (perhaps also use the decomposition in [westerbaan2020thethree](westerbaan2020thethree))
