## Abstract 
  We prove that for a large class of quantum Fisher information, a quantum
channel is sufficient for a family of quantum states, i.e., the input states
can be recovered from the output, if and only if the quantum Fisher information
is preserved under the quantum channel. This class, for instance, includes
Winger-Yanase-Dyson skew information. On the other hand, interestingly, the SLD
quantum Fisher information, as the most popular example of quantum analog of
Fisher information, does not satisfy this property.
Our recoverability result is obtained by studying Riemannian monotone metrics
on the quantum state space, i.e. metrics monotone decreasing under the action
of quantum channels, a property often called data processing inequality. For
two quantum states, the monotone metric gives the corresponding quantum
$\chi^2$ divergence. We obtain an approximate recovery result in the sense
that, if the quantum $\chi^2$ divergence is approximately preserved by a
quantum channel, then two states can be approximately recovered by the Petz
recovery map. We also obtain a universal recovery bound for the
$\chi_{\frac{1}{2}}$ divergence.
Finally, we discuss applications in the context of quantum thermodynamics and
the resource theory of asymmetry.
