## Abstract 
We explicitly describe the Haagerup and the Kosaki non-commutative $L^p$-spaces associated with a tensor product von Neumann algebra $M_1\bar{\otimes}M_2$ in terms of those associated with $M_i$ and usual tensor products of unbounded operators. The descriptions are then shown to be useful in the quantum information theory based on operator algebras.
