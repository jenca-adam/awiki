\bigskip

A testing region is the image of the set of states (or effects) under a measurement (or a set
of quantum states, also called a statistical experiment) seen as linear mappings. In the
present paper, the testing regions are approximated by ellipsoids, or other sets that the
authors call d-cones. These approximations are optimal, at least in
the information complete case, in the sense that the outer approximations are the minimal
and the inner approximations the maximal possible.



The authors claim that their results are used to provide a semi-device independent test of
the possibility to transform one measurement (or statistical experiment) to another by a
quantum channel. But this is not exactly true, e.g. in Corollary 1,  in general,  only the
existence of a positive
map on the span of the POVM is proved, which may not even have a positive extension to all
of $\mathcal L(\mathbb C^d)$, let alone being completely positive. The only case when
existence of a channel can be shown is under precisely the same conditions as in Corollary
2 of Ref. [21], so this is hardly an extension of the said corollary to arbitrary
dimensional case, as the authors claim. There is a similar problem with Corollary 2, which is
claimed to be an extesion of Corollary 1 in [21].  So, in fact, the improvement that is
provided in the present paper is that the conditions given in terms of approximating ellipsoids or
d-cones are more tractable than the testing regions. 

Nevertheless, the approximations obtained in the paper could be of some ineterest, but the
paper is not written very well. I think it would add value to the paper if the authors
were more pedagogical, and provide more explanations on their arguments and underlying
ideas, not just giving references to other results without further comments.

\textbf{Some specific comments}


\begin{itemize}
\item page 3, Definition 1: better explain here that $Q^+$ is the pseudoinverse, this is
not yet clear at this point
\item page 3, example of the SIC measurement: $\hat{\mathbf{u}}$ is not defined.
\item page 4, Corollary 1: what is the ''support of $\mathbf{\pi}_0$''?
\item page 4, the definition of a $d$-cone is quite unclear. Also for the symmetric
$d$-cone: it seems that the last ball should have radius 0, which should follow from $r(L)=r(0)=0$, but
then there is another ball at the origin. So actually there are $d+1$ balls.
\item page 6, Corollary 2: what is the ''support of $\rho_0$''?
\item page 9, proof of Theorem 1: the paragraph starting with ''The inner ellipsoid...''
is very unclear and should be better explained.
\item page 11, proof of Theorem 2: should be better explained. (Perhaps it would suffice if
the proof of Theorem 1 was better written.)
\end{itemize}
