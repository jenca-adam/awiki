## Content

1. An extension of the AU-theorem for families of *real* qubit states: 

     * this is quite easy, since the  linear span of a real family of qubits has
dimension at most 2, which allows us to apply the Alberti-Uhlmann criterion to any pair that spans it and extend the
resulting map over the rest.  
     * in general, an extension to larger families of states (beyond pairs) is not true even in the classical case (see
       [strasser](strasser)) 

1. If the span of the source family contains  $I$, then the target states are allowed to be qutrits

1. For measurements: one is a pre-processing of another if the source is qubit real and the target can be qutrit

     * This (and te previous) follows by some easy linear algebra (basically from the fact that a surjective linear map
      has a one-sided inverse).
