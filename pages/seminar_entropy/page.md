title: Entropy in category theory
---
We study characterizations of entropy on a simplex, some classical (Shannon, RÃ©nyi, Fadeev,...) and some from category theory (Baez, Fritz, Leinster,...). 
We want to extend some ideas to find a categorial definition of entropy for (at least some types of) convex sets. We look at existing definitions  (Kimura et al, etc), is there a categorial definition?
