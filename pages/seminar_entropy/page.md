title: Entropy in category theory
---
## Ideas

* We study characterizations of entropy on a simplex, some classical [faddeev1956kponiatju](/static/other/faddeev1956kponiatju.pdf), 
[renyi1961onmeasures](/static/other/renyi1961onmeasures.pdf),
(Shannon, RÃ©nyi,...) and some from category theory (Baez, Fritz, Leinster,...). 

* We want to extend some ideas to find a categorial definition of entropy for (at least some types of) convex sets. We look at existing definitions  (Kimura et al, etc), is there a categorial definition?
