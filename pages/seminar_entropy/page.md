title: Entropy in category theory
---
## Ideas

* We study characterizations of entropy on a simplex:

some classical [shannon1948amathematical](/static/other/shannon1948amathematical.pdf), ([faddeev1956kponiatju](/static/other/faddeev1956kponiatju.pdf), 
[renyi1961onmeasures](/static/other/renyi1961onmeasures.pdf),

and some from category theory [baez2011acharacterization](baez2011acharacterization) (Leinster,...). 

* We want to extend some ideas to find a categorial definition of entropy for (at least some types of) convex sets. We look at existing definitions  (Kimura et al, etc), is there a categorial definition?
