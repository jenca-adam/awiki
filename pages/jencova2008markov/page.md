## Abstract 
  The paper contains a detailed computation about the algebra of canonical
commutation relation, the representation of the Weyl unitaries, the quasi-free
states and their von Neumann entropy. The Markov triplet is defined by constant
entropy increase. The Markov property of a quasi-free state is described by the
representing block matrix. The proof is based on results on the statistical
sufficiency in the quantum case. The relation to classical Gaussian Markov
triplets is also described.
