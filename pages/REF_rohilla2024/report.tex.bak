\centerline{Referee report}

\bigskip

An $S$-space is a Hilbert space equipped with a sesquilinear form given by a unitary
operator $U$. Positivity of operators with respect to this form is called $U$-positivity. 
This paper studies related notions of positive, completely positive maps and channels, 
and proves some representations and properties similar to those of usual channels.

\noindent
\textbf{Overall evaluation}



\medskip


No motivation for studying the topic of the paper is given. The authors list some previous
works, but no aplications of the $U$-channels to quantum information or elsewhere are described.
Moreover, the $U$-channels ($U$-states, $U$-CP maps, etc..) have an obvious relation to
the usual quantum channels (states, CP-maps, etc...), and all the results can  be
straightforwardly  obtained from the well known results by
this relation. I do not see any ''added value'' in this paper,  so I cannot recommend its
publication.

\medskip

A further remark: According to Def. 5.1, a $(U_A,U_B)$-channel $\psi$ is $(U_A,U_B)$-CP and trace
preserving. But this is not in agreement with the rest of the paper, where it is actually
assumed that the related map $\phi(X)=U_B^*\psi(U_AX)$ is a channel (CP and trace preserving).
This is a quite different condition.
