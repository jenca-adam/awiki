**Report:**
There are two types of compatibility of instruments treated before in the literature: the classical one inherited from compatibility of POVMs, and the parallel one, which is obtained by treating quantum instruments as  channels. This contribution closes the gap between these two types, in establishing a hierarchy of different notions of compatibility of instruments, in which both of these instances are contained. The instruments are compatible if they can be obtained from a single instrument by post-processing, 
the notions in the hierarchy are determined  by considering  restrictions on the  types of post-processings. The restrictions are  given by different  treatment of the classical and the quantum outputs of the instrument. In the second part, the corresponding hierarchy of resource theories is studied.


The description of the different notions of compatibility  appears to be a new idea which I find very important for understanding the nature of compatibility of quantum instruments (and could be perhaps  extended to other types of channels with a natural division of the output spaces into distinct parts). Another interesting and useful idea is the ''spatial'' interpretation where the family of instruments (seen as a single programmable instrument) is arranged between two separated parties, a quantum and a classical one.   All the allowed post-processings are then given in terms of local operations and classical communication between the parties. This description is conveniently used in determining the free operations and a complete family resource monotones in the corresponding resource theories. Other considerations in the resource theoretic part seem quite standard and are commonly used in convex resource theories of processes. 

This contribution could become a nice and inspiring talk for the audience interested in quantum foundations as well as quantum resource theories. In this case, I would suggest that the authors make an effort in explaining the basic ideas. For example, I struggled with their interpretation of no-exclusivity, until I consulted the paper [22] where a more specialized version of this notion is treated.

Questions:
- Is there some relation between the resource monotones and the incompatibility witnesses defined in arXiv:1906.10904?
- Is there some kind of  characterization of these notions of incompatibility by concatenation, similar to arXiv:1608.01794 (see also arXiv:2212.11225)?
