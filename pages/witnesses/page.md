* extremal measurements?
* measurements on polysimplexes (or more general products): 
     * a product state space is a special subset of the product of cones
     * in convex cones, product=coproduct (finite)
     * measurement = map from product extends to a map from coproduct of cones = coproduct of maps 
     * extremal?
