## Notes

* notes by Alessandro, Teiko, Claudio on [witnesses](witnesses/toigo.pdf)
* my notes on [witnesses](witnesses/aj_witnesses.pdf)
* my notes on [spectrahedra](witnesses/aj_spectrahedra.pdf)
* notes by Andreas and Ion on spectrahedra and [gpt](witnesses/bluhm.pdf)
* my notes on witnesses and [symmetric state spaces](witnesses/notes_symmetric.pdf)

## Questions

* the cross norm gamma [defined here](witnesses/notes_symmetric.pdf), the dual cross norm is on $A\otimes \ell_1^k$, that is
on $k$-tuples $f_1,\dots,f_k\in A(K)$. This should relate to existence of positive extensions, as in [the b-n notes](witnesses/bluhm.pdf): $\gamma^\*(f_1,\dots,f_k)\le 1$ iff a positive extension exists 
* related to previous: map extensions and conic programming
* incompatibility on $W$ - the min tensor product of two quantum state spaces (two qubits)
* relations of incompatibility, free spectrahedra, operator systems and norms - one should write some notes on this
* measurements with more outcomes
