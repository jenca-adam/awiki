ABSTRACT:

Traditional Bayes' rule lays the foundation for causal reasoning and
finding} relation between cause (input) and effect (output). \mnb{This
causal reasoning is universally applied to all physical processes to
establish causal relations.} Here, we show \mnb{that it does not
establish correct causal correspondence between quantum causes and
effects in general.} In fact, there are instances within the framework
of quantum mechanics where the use of traditional Bayes' rule leads to
inconsistencies in quantum measurement inferences. We consider two
such cases, inspired by Frauchiger-Renner's and Hardy's setups, where
traditional Bayes' rule results in paradoxical situations even after
assuming quantum mechanics as a non-local theory. As a remedy, we
introduce an input-output causal relation \mnb{using the reasoning}
based on quantum Bayes' rule. It applies to general quantum processes
even when a cause (or effect) is in coherent superposition with other
causes (or effects), involves non-local correlations as allowed by
quantum mechanics, and in the cases where causes belonging to one
system induce effects in some other system as it happens in quantum
measurement processes. This enables us to propose a resolution to the
contradictions that appear in the context of Frauchiger-Renner's and
Hardy's setups. Our results thereby affirm that quantum mechanics,
equipped with quantum Bayes' rule, can indeed consistently describe
the use of itself.

Report of the Third Referee -- XV10673A/Bera
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The authors claim that a couple of well-known paradoxes of inference
in quantum mechanics are resolved when the so-called quantum Bayes
rule is used instead of the "classical" Bayes rule for (causal)
inference. First they recall the standard Bayes rule and give a quick
introduction to an inferential map dubbed the quantum Bayes rule in
the framework developed by Leifer and Spekkens in reference [7]. Then
they compare the quantum and classical settings, essentially claiming
that in a purely inferential/logical sense, the "classical" Bayes rule
is an inadequate tool for dealing with inference in a quantum
scenario. To back up their claim they consider the Frauchiger--Renner
paradox and one by Hardy from the perspective of the quantum causal
model and propose that both paradoxes are resolved once classical
inference is replaced with the appropriate quantum ones.

The main technical contribution of this paper is to cast the
aforementioned paradoxes in the causal language of reference [7].
Doing so ends up being rather straightforward; despite the generality
of the formalism introduced in section 2, they only ultimately need
unitary dynamics and rank-1 projective measurements to treat the
paradoxes and for this setting the quantum retrodiction reduces to
applying an inverse unitary to the resulting ket. In any case, at a
glance, their technical analysis appears to be correct.

However, I believe the authors have drawn incorrect conclusions and as
such I cannot recommend publication in its current form. Just reading
the abstract, I knew something had to be wrong because the "classical"
Bayes rule, understood correctly, is not classical or quantum --- it's
a purely logical statement which is true in any universe. Put another
way, the quantum Bayes rule does not replace Bayes rule. The quantum
Bayes rule is a relation, derived *within* the quantum formalism,
between input and output states for a given channel. Meanwhile the
regular Bayes rule is a consequence of coherent reasoning and so can
be used *with* a physical theory, such as classical or quantum
mechanics, but does not itself belong to either. A common example is
to use Bayesian updating to refine a prior distribution over possible
states in quantum state tomography. There one has a prior probability
density over the potential hypotheses (that is, quantum states) and
the likelihood/model is given by quantum theory through the Born rule.

This is a common confusion which I have seen many times before and
which I believe comes from talk of quantum theory as a generalization
of probability theory. It's actually better to say quantum theory is
an *addition* to probability theory because what it actually does is
extend the scope of probabilistic constraints in much the same way
trying to be consistent with any physical theory might. But quantum
theory doesn't deprecate the *concept* of a probability; it's true
that in the standard representation we manipulate complex-valued
matrices, but standard probabilities are there at the beginning and
end in state preparation and measurement and, furthermore, any quantum
state *just is* a probability distribution over the outcomes of an
informationally complete measurement. All this to say that inference
itself is a pre-physical concept and so the purported lesson of the
paper must be wrong.

The issue is apparent in their simple example comparing classical and
quantum causal reasoning, example 1 in section 3. There they are
ultimately comparing incomparable things because to discuss the
supposed classical inference, they consider "a classical stochastic
process analogous to the evolution". Why would I expect consistency
between quantum mechanics and a different physical theory? To try to
put them on the same footing, their classical model treats the
outcomes of a computational basis measurement as underlying states of
reality, when we already know from quantum mechanics that they are
not. If we nonetheless allow the Born rule probabilities for state
measurements from quantum mechanics to define all of the probabilities
used in a classical inference, the issue remains that the actual
experiment being done is fundamentally different: in the quantum
situation they are considering one coherent isometric evolution
followed by a measurement while in the classical part of the example,
the fact that they use measurement probabilities for the prior and
likelihood implies they are considering an intermediate measurement
setup instead. Measurement matters! Thus, I conclude they are knocking
down a straw man.

Despite this serious and fundamental error, there may be some value in
the technical aspect I mentioned earlier, but the whole discourse
would need to be repackaged before it would be possible to adequately
assess.
