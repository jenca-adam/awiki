## Abstract 
  The quantum relative entropy between two states satisfies a monotonicity
property meaning that applying the same quantum channel to both states can
never increase their relative entropy. It is known that this inequality is only
tight when there is a "recovery map" that exactly reverses the effects of the
quantum channel on both states. In this paper we strengthen this inequality by
showing that the difference of relative entropies is bounded below by the
measured relative entropy between the first state and a recovered state from
its processed version. The recovery map is a convex combination of rotated Petz
recovery maps and perfectly reverses the quantum channel on the second state.
As a special case we reproduce recent lower bounds on the conditional mutual
information such as the one proved in [Fawzi and Renner, Commun. Math. Phys.,
2015]. Our proof only relies on elementary properties of pinching maps and the
operator logarithm.
