The decoherence-free subalgebra of a channel on $B(\mathcal H)$, in the presence of a faithful normal  invariant state. It is proved that this subalgebra coincides with the subalgebra of the Glicksberg-jacobs-DeLeeuw decomposition. The structure of this subalgebra and the subalgebra of fixed points is studied and a notion of a period is defined also in the reducible case. Homogeneous open quantum random walks are studied as examples, including one irreducible without invariant states.

## Ideas

1. In the case with faithful normal  invariant state (FNIS), one can study the spectral gap and the exponential decay outside 
$\mathcal N(\Phi)$.
1. Describe the decoherence-free subalgebra without FNIS, using the paper [arveson](/static/pdf/nejake.pdf))
