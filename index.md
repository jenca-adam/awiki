* [Tensor products of DEA](/static/pdf/nejake.pdf):

 An effect algebra tensor product of dimension effect algebras (DEA) is a DEA. 

* [Real interval as DEA](/static/pdf/nejake.pdf):

The interval $[0,1]$ in $\mathbb R$ as a direct limit of finite MV-algebras.

## Ideas

1. The effect algebra tensor product   $[0,1]\otimes [0,1]$ can be identified as follows:  Take $\mathbb R$ as a vector space over $\mathbb Q$ and take the tensor product $\mathbb R\otimes_{\mathbb Q}\mathbb R$, with the smallest cone such that it becomes a partially ordered abelian group such that the tensor product of positive elements is positive.  Take the interval $[0,1\otimes 1]$ in this ordered group.
